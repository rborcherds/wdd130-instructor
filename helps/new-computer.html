        <h1>Setup New Computer for coding with GitHub</h1>
        <p>This page describes how to set up a new computer for a student to keep working
            with GitHub without having to recreate the code or the repository.</p>
        <h2>Setup VSCode</h2>
        <p>Install VSCode and the extensions that are require for class. Do not install
            extra extension as they will not be used and will slow down the startup time.
        </p>
        <h2>Setup Git</h2>
        <p>Make sure to run the 3 commands for windows or 2 for Mac and Linux</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Type in this configuration command to set the global git username:
                <pre> git config --global user.name "your GitHub username" </pre> and hit
                Enter.
                Nothing will happen if you did it right. If you get an error, you need to
                fix it.
            </li>
            <li>Enter this configuration command to set the email:
                <pre> git config --global user.email "your email@example.com"</pre> and
                hit Enter.
                Nothing will happen if you did it right. If you get an error, you need to
                fix it.
            </li>
            <li>This next command is for Windows only. It does not hurt to also type this
                command on the MAC and Linux system. Type in this configuration command in
                order to not ignore case changes in files and folder names:
                <pre>git config --global core.ignorecase false</pre> and hit Enter.
                Nothing will happen if you did it right. If you get an error, you need to
                fix it.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Go to Repository on GitHub</h2>
        <p>Log into your GitHub account. Open the repository. Click on the icons in the
            following image in the order shown with numbers.</p>
        <figure> <img src="images/github-clone-urlpng"
                alt="How to get the clone URL for a GitHub repository">
            <figcaption>The second icon will copy the URL to the left of it to the
                clipboard on your computer.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <h2>Open VSCode</h2>
        <p>Open VSCode and then open the parent folder of where you want to put your code.
            In this example I will use Desktop</p>
        <p>Once you have opened the folder in VSCode using the FILE - OPEN FOLDER menu,
            then open a terminal window using CTRL+SHIFT+` or use the menus at the top
            TERMINAL - NEW TERMINAL
        </p>
        <p>Type the following command into the terminal</p>
        <pre>git clone &gt;paste the github URL you copied with the second click&lt;</pre>
        <p>This will create a clone of the wdd130 folder from GitHub onto your computer on
            the Desktop.</p>
        <h2>Finish Setup</h2>
        <p>Now you need to make any edit and save it. Then go to the Source Control and
            commit and sync with GutHub. This will force the Git and GitHub authorization
            logins to take place.
        </p>
        <h3>If you have any issues with this make sure to contact your instructor for
            additional help.</h3>
