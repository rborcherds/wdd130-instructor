    <h1>GitHub Features</h1>
    <p>GitHub is a powerful platform for version control and collaboration. Here are some
      of the key features that make it a popular choice among developers:</p>

    <details>
      <summary>How to delete a repository and reset VSCode</summary>
      <p>To delete a repository you must go to the settings tab inside the repository on
        GitHub.</p>
      <img src="images/github-repository-menu.webp" alt="GitHub repository menu">
      <p>Once there, scroll to the very bottom of the page, you will see a section called
        "Danger Zone".</p>
      <p>Click on the "Delete this repository" button.</p>
      <img src="images/github-repository-danger-zone.webp"
        alt="GitHub repository danger zone">
      <p>Once you have clicked on the button, you will be asked to confirm that you want
        to delete the repository.</p>
      <p>To confirm that you want to delete the repository, you must type the name of the
        repository in the text box.</p>
      <p>Once you have typed the name of the repository, click on the "I understand the
        consequences, delete this repository" button.</p>
      <p>You will be asked to enter your GitHub password as the items in the Danger Zone
        are administration activities and you must authenticate to use them.</p>
      <p>Note that deleting a repository will delete all the issues, pull requests, and
        wiki pages associated with the repository.</p>
      <p>Also note that deleting a repository will not delete the local repository on your
        computer, so you will need to delete the local repository manually.</p>
      <p>To delete the local repository, you will need to remove the folder that contains
        the
        repository on your computer.</p>
      <h2>These steps unlinks your local folder with GitHub</h2>

      <p>Open the root folder of the repository in VSCode.</p>
      <p>Open a terminal in VSCode. On Windows you use Ctrl+` and on a MAC you use âŒƒ` or
        you can use the menu option VIEW - Terminal.</p>

      <p>Once the terminal is open, type the following command:</p>
      <p>On Windows:</p>
      <pre><code>Remove-Item c:\Tmp\* -Recurse -Force</code></pre>

      <p>On a Mac and Linux:</p>
      <pre><code>rm .git -rf</code></pre>

      <p>These commands removes the tracking folder that GIT uses when syncing with
        GitHub. This hidden folder contains all the configuration information and tracking
        the changes to know what to sync with GitHub.</p>

      <summary>How to rename a repository</summary>
      <p>To rename a repository you must go to the settings tab inside the repository on
        GitHub.</p>
      <p>Once there, you will see a section called "Repository name".</p>
      <img src="images/github-repository-rename.webp" alt="Rename a repository">
      <p>Click on the name of the repository and change it to the new name.</p>
      <p>Once you have changed the name, click on the "Rename" button to save the changes.
      </p>
      <p>Note that renaming a repository will change the URL of the repository, so you
        will need to update any
        links to the repository.</p>
      <p>Also note that renaming a repository will not change the name of the local
        repository on your computer,
        so you will need to update the remote URL in your local repository.</p>
      <p>To update the remote URL in your local repository, you can use the following
        command:</p>
      <pre><code>git remote set-url origin new-url</code></pre>
      <p>Where <code>new-url</code> is the new URL of the repository.
      </p>
      <p>You can find the new URL by going to the Code tab and then click on the <span
          class="gh-btn">
          <> Code
        </span> button</p>
      <img src="images/github-repository-code-url.webp" alt="Where to find the new URL">
      <p>Once you have clicked on the button, you will see a tab called Local, make sure
        it is selected. Then make sure HTTPS is selected and the URL will be shown.</p>
      <p>Click on the "Copy" button to copy the URL to your clipboard. The copy button is
        the icon to the right of the URL. You can then just paste the URL into the
        terminal where you are typing your command.</p>
      <img src="images/github-repository-url-location.webp"
        alt="Where to find the new URL">
      <p>For example, if you renamed your repository from <code>wdd130</code> to
        <code>wdd130-old</code>, the
        new URL would be <code>https://githubusername.github.io/wdd130-old</code>.
      </p>
      <p>This is the full command you would type remember to use your GitHub Username</p>
      <pre><code>git remote set-url origin https://githubusername.github.io/wdd130-old</code></pre>
      <p>To check the remote URL of your local repository, you can use the following
        command:</p>
      <pre><code>git remote -v</code></pre>

    <details>
      <summary>How to change a repository visibility</summary>
      <p>To change a repository visibility you must go to the settings tab inside the
        repository on GitHub.</p>
      <p>Once there, you will see a section called "Danger Zone".</p>
      <p>Click on the "Change repository visibility" button.</p>
      <p>Once you click on the button, you will see the option attached to the button to
        change to the opposite of what the current visibility is. If it is private, you
        will see "Change to Public". </p>
      <p>You will then be prompted to verify you want to make the change and you may have
        to enter your password to verify you identity and make the change. GitHub will
        only ask for your password about every 2 hours from the last time you entered the
        password.</p>
