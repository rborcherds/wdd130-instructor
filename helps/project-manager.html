    <h1>Users with multiple coding projects/classes</h1>
    <p>It is recommended that if you are doing multiple coding projects at a time and
      each has its own folder/directory structure, you install an extension called Project
      Manager </p>
    <p>Go to extensions</p>
    <p>Search for Project Manager</p>
    <img src="images/project-manager-search.png" alt="Search Project Manager">
    <p>Click Install.</p>
    <p>Once installed open one project folder in VSCode</p>
    <p> Click on the Project Manager icon in the icons on the left or right of the
      editor </p>
    <img src="images/project-manager-icon.png" alt="Project Manager Icon">
    <p> You should see a blue button that states: Project Manager: Save Project -
      Click that button and you will be prompted for a name at the top center of the
      screen. The
      default name is the folder name. </p>
    <img src="images/project-manager-1st-save.png" alt="Project Manager 1st Save">
    <p>You will be prompted to give the project a name</p>
    <img src="images/project-mananger-naming.png" alt="Naming Project">
    <p> That will then add that project name to the Project Manager list of projects.
    </p>
    <p>Open the second project folder in its own workspace.</p>
    <p>Click the Save icon in the Project Manager folder icon area.</p>
    <img src="images/project-manager-save.png" alt="Project Manager Save">
    <p> Give your project a name and hit enter. This will add it to the list. </p>
    <img src="images/project-mananger-naming.png" alt="Naming Project">
    <p> If you click the edit icon, it will open the JSON file that lists your
      projects. The format is quite easy to follow. The rule is that each project must be
      enclosed
      with { } and must have a comma between the project section. </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span class="bold-text">Name</span> is the name of the project
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="bold-text">Rootpath</span> is the path to the project.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="bold-text">Paths</span> is not used at this time
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="bold-text">Tags</span> is a way to categorize the type of project
        for sorting. This list is up to the person
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="bold-text">Enabled</span> is if the project will display or not
        in the list of projects. This is a way to only show projects you are currently
        working on.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>This is the format of the JSON File</p>
    <pre>
      {<br>
      "name": "WDD-130",<br>
      "rootPath": "/var/www/html/school/wdd130",<br>
      "paths": [],<br>
      "tags": ["School", "WDD-130"],<br>
      "enabled": true<br>
      },
    </pre>
