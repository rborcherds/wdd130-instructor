    <h1>Retaking WDD130 at BYU-Idaho</h1>
    <p>If you are retaking WDD130, please follow these instructions to set up your
      computer:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          Go into GitHub and rename your repository to include "wdd130" and add something
          descriptive like old or previous such as "wdd130-old". This image shows the
          entry
          box and it is found in the repository settings tab / General menu at the top.
        </p>
        <img src="images/github-repository-rename.webp" alt="GitHub rename repository">
        <p>Once you have typed the new name, click "Rename" button.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Rename the folder on your local computer from wdd130 to match what you renamed
          the repository to. How you do this will depend on your operating system.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>There is one of three things you can do at this point:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Delete the local repository folder and re-clone the renamed repository from
            GitHub.</li>
          <li>Edit the .git/config file in the renamed folder to point to the new
            repository
            name.</li>
          <li>Use the git command line to set the new URL for the renamed repository.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Here are the instructions for the last two options:</p>
        <h2>Editing the .git/config file</h2>
        <p>Open the .git folder inside the renamed local repository folder. Inside that
          folder is a file called config. Open that file in a text editor such as VSCode
          or Notepad.</p>
        <p>Find the line that starts with "url = " and change the URL to match the new
          repository name on GitHub.</p>
        <img src="images/vscode--git-config.webp"
          alt="VSCode showing the .git/config file line to edit">
        <p>You can get the new URL by opening the repository on GitHub and copying the URL
          from the address bar and add .git at the end like the image above.</p>
        <p>This process will allow you to keep the old code in sync with GitHub.</p>

        <h2>Using the git command line to set the new URL</h2>
        <p>Open a terminal in VSCode. On Windows you use Ctrl+` and on a MAC you use âŒƒ` or
          you can use the menu option VIEW - Terminal.</p>
        <p>Once the terminal is open, type the following command, replacing the NEW-URL
          with
          the new repository URL:</p>
        <pre><code>git remote set-url origin NEW-URL</code></pre>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Now continue with the rest of the setup instructions found at <a
