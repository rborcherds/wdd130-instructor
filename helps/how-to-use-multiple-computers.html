        <h1>How to code with multiple computers without causing conflicts</h1>
        <p>When you are working on a project, you may want to use multiple computers. This
            is common for students who work on their assignments at home and at school.
        </p>
        <p>To do this, you need to make sure that you are using GitHub correctly to avoid
            conflicts. Here are the steps to
            follow:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Make sure you have Git installed on all computers.</li>
            <li>Clone your GitHub repository to each computer.</li>
            <li>Before you start working, pull the latest changes from GitHub.</li>
            <li>When you finish working, commit your changes and push them to GitHub.</li>
            <li>Before switching computers, always pull the latest changes from GitHub.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>By following these steps, you can work on your project from multiple computers
            without causing conflicts. If you do encounter a conflict, Git will help you
            resolve it.</p>
        <p>For more information on how to use Git and GitHub, you can refer to the <a
                href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart">GitHub Quickstart
                Guide</a>.</p>
        <p>Remember to always commit your changes and push them to GitHub before switching
            computers. This will ensure that your work is saved and can be accessed from
            any computer.</p>

        <h2>Here are the step-by-step instructions</h2>
        <p>Follow the instructions found in the <a href="new-computer.html">Setup New
                Computer</a>. These instructions are specific to school work and you may
            have to do other things for work setup.</p>
        <p>Open VSCode on your computer and go to the Source Control icon</p>
        <img src="images/vscode-source-control.webp" alt="Source Control icon">
        <p>Then click on the 3 dots to the right of Changes and select Branch - Create New
            Branch</p>
        <img src="images/vscode-new-branch.webp" alt="Create New Branch">
        <p>Enter a name for your branch, such as "dev" and press Enter. The branch name
            can be anything you want to use.</p>
        <img src="images/vscode-new-branch-name.webp" alt="Enter New Branch Name">
        <p>
            Click the Publish Branch button that appears at the top of the Source Control
            panel. This will create the branch on GitHub and set it as the current branch
            in VSCode.
        </p>
        <img src="images/vscode-publish-branch.webp" alt="Publish Branch">
        <p>Now you can make changes to your code without affecting the main branch. When
            you are ready to save your changes, you can commit them to the new branch. You
            can verify that you are on the new branch by checking the branch name in the
            bottom left corner of the VSCode window.</p>
        <img src="images/vscode-check-branch-name.webp" alt="Check Branch Name">
        <p>Now you can make all the edits you want on this computer. To use the same
            branch on another computer, you need to follow these steps:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Commit and sync your changes from the original computer to GitHub.</li>
            <li>Open VSCode on the new computer.</li>
            <li>Clone your GitHub repository to the new computer if not already on your
                computer.</li>
            <li>Open the Source Control panel and click on the 3 dots to the right of
                Changes.</li>
            <li>Select Branch - Checkout to Branch and choose the branch you created.</li>
        </ol>
        <img src="images/vscode-branch-checkout-to.webp" alt="Checkout Branch">
        <p>Now you can continue working on the same branch on the new computer. Remember
            to always pull the latest changes from GitHub before making any changes, and
            push your changes when you are done.</p>
        <p>Make sure to always do a pull request before you start to work on the new
            computer.</p>
        <img src="images/vscode-git-pull.webp" alt="Git Pull Request">
        <p>If you ever get a Merge Conflict and you are not sure how to fix that, contact
            your instructor or refer to this video on YouTube that shows you how to fix a
            merge conflict. <a

        <h2>Merging dev branch to main branch to publish on GitHub Pages</h2>
        <p>As you push changes to GitHub, you may see the following message in Github on
            the Code page of your repository. You can ignore this until you are ready to
            merge it into the main branch.</p>
        <img src="images/github-auto-pull-request-notice.webp"
            alt="Auto Pull Request Notice">
        </p>
        <p>Once you are ready to publish your code so that it is available on GitHub Pages
            for grading, follow these steps.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Make sure you are on the dev branch in VSCode.</li>
            <li>Commit all your changes to the dev branch.</li>
            <li>Push the dev branch to GitHub.</li>
            <li>Go to GitHub and create a pull request from the dev branch to the main
                branch.</li>
            <li>Review the changes and merge the pull request.</li>
            <li>Switch back to the main branch in VSCode.</li>
            <li>Pull the latest changes from the main branch.</li>
            <li>Now your main branch is up to date with the dev branch.</li>
        </ol>
        <img src="images/github-new-pull-request.webp" alt="New Pull Request">
        <p>You will then select the main branch as the base branch and the dev branch as
            the compare branch.</p>
        <img src="images/github-base-compare-branch.webp" alt="Compare Branches">
        <p>The web page will then fill in and it will look something like this.</p>
        <img src="images/github-compare-pull-request.webp" alt="Compare Pull Request">
        <p>Click on the "Create pull request" button to create the pull request.</p>
        <p>GitHub will then show you the changes that will be merged into the main
            branch. You can review the changes and make sure everything looks good.</p>
        <p>Once you are satisfied with the changes, you can add a title and description
            for the pull request. This will help you and others understand what changes
            were made and why. The screen will look something like this.</p>
        <img src="images/github-pull-request-title.webp" alt="Pull Request Title">
        <p>After you have added a title and description, click on the "Create pull
            request" button. This will create the pull request and notify the repository
            owner that there are changes ready to be reviewed. The owner in this case is
            you.</p>
        <p>After you have created the pull request, you will see the page to merge the
            pull request. This will only show you the Merge ull request button if there
            are no conflicts with the code in the main branch. If there are conflicts you
            will have to decide how to handle the conflict so that you can merge the other
            changes into main.</p>
        <img src="images/github-pull-request-details.webp" alt="Pull Request Details">
        <p>You can add more details in the comment area below the button. That is not
            necessary as you should be the only one making changes. This part is mainly
            used when there are multiple developers working on a project.</p>
        <p>Click on the "Merge pull request" button to merge the changes from the dev
            branch into the main branch.</p>
        <p>After you click the "Merge pull request" button, GitHub will show you a
            confirmation page. You can review the changes one last time before merging.
            Click the Confirm merge button to finalize the merge.</p>
        <img src="images/github-confirm-branch-merge.webp"
            alt="Merge Pull Request Confirmation">
        <p>Once you confirm the merge, GitHub will merge the changes from the dev branch
            into the main branch. You will see a message indicating that the pull request
            was successfully merged.</p>
        <img src="images/github-branch-merge-success.webp" alt="Pull Request Merged">
        <p>Once the pull request is merged, Give the system a couple of minutes and your
            changes will be live on GitHub Pages.</p>
