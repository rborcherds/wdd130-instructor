        <h1>Setup New Computer for coding with GitHub</h1>
        <p>This page describes how to set up a new computer for a student to keep working with
            GitHub without having to recreate the code or the repository.</p>
        <h2>Setup VSCode</h2>
        <p>Install VSCode and the extensions that are require for class. Do not install extra
            extension as they will not be used and will slow down the startup time.</p>
        <h2>Setup Git</h2>
        <p>Make sure to run the 3 commands for windows or 2 for Mac and Linux</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Type in this configuration command to set the global git username:
                <pre> git config --global user.name "yourusername" </pre> and click Enter. Nothing
                will happen if you did it right. If you get an error, you need to fix it.
            </li>
            <li>Enter this configuration command to set the email:
                <pre> git config --global user.email "youremail@"</pre> and click Enter. Nothing
                will happen if you did it right. If you get an error, you need to fix it.
            </li>
            <li>This next command is for Windows only. It does not hurt to also type this command on
                the MAC and Linux system. Type in this configuration command in order to not ignore
                case changes in files and folder names:
                <pre>git config --global core.ignorecase false</pre> and click Enter. Nothing will
                happen if you did it right. If you get an error, you need to fix it.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Go to Repository on Gitub</h2>
        <p>Log into your GitHub account. Open the repsoritoy. Click on the icons in the following
            image in the order shown with numbers.</p>
        <figure>
            <img src="images/github-clone-urlpng"
                alt="How to get the clone URL for a GitHub repository">
            <figcaption>The second icon will copy the URL to the left of it to the clipboard on your
                computer.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <h2>Open VSCode</h2>
        <p>Open VSCode and then open the parent folder of where you want to put your code. In this
            example I will use Desktop</p>
        <p>Once you have opened the folder in VSCode using the FILE - OPEN FOLDER menu, then open a
            terminal window using CTRL+SHIFT+` or use the menus at the top TERMINAL - NEW TERMINAL
        </p>
        <p>Type the following command into the terminal</p>
        <pre>git clone &gt;paste the github URL you copied with the second click&lt;</pre>
        <p>This will create a clone of the wdd130 folder from GitHub onto your computer on the
            Desktop.</p>
        <h2>Finish Setup</h2>
        <p>Now you need to make any edit and save it. Then go to the Source Control and commit and
            sync with GutHub. This will force the Git and GitHub authorization logins to take place.
        </p>
