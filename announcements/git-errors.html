        <img src="images/git-gpg-no-key.png" alt="Git No GPG Error">
        <p> This has to do with how Git is configured with GPG signing process. This is an
          issue on
          Windows computers, as the GPG implementation is weird. </p>
        <p> There are a few potential ways to fix this issue. I would recommend turning
          off the
          signing with GPG. </p>
        <p>Here are the steps to disable this option</p>
        <p>Go to VSCode preferences - Settings</p>
        <img src="images/gpg-1.png" alt="GPG error steps 1">
        <p> Type this into the search bar at the top to find the setting: gpg commit </p>
        <img src="images/gpg-2.png" alt="GPG error step 2">
        <p> Make sure this option is not checked. This is the option that tells VSCode to
          use PGP
          while pushing to GitHub: Enables commit signing with GPG or X.509 </p>
        <img src="images/gpg-3.png" alt="GPG error step 3">

          GitHub
        </summary>
        <p>This error occurs when you have GitHub setup on one account and you try to use
          another
          account and GitHub auto logs you into the old account with VSCode. This process
          is using the Windows Credential Manager.</p>
        <img src="images/git-error-push-github.png" alt="Git Error no authorization">
        <p>This error is because Git was previously configured for another user account on
          the
          computer using the global settings. There are a a few solutions.</p>
        <details>
          <summary>Remove Windows Credential Manager from auto logging into GitHub
          </summary>
          <p>This is the preferred method if the account in question is not being used
            anymore</p>
          <p>There are two part to this. If you only do one of them it will work. It is
            recommended to do both parts.</p>
          <p>Go to GitHub and log into the old account and click on the user profile
            picture in the
            top right of the web page. <span class="menu-select"> Select Settings</span>

          <p>Then click on the <span class="menu-select">Authorized Oauth Apps</span> tab

          <img src="images/github-oauth-link.png" alt="GitHub Oauth entry">
          <p>Click the <span class="menu-select">Revoke</span> option</p>
          <img src="images/github-revoke-oauth.png" alt="GitHub Revoke OAuth">
          <p>This will force VSCode to re-authenticate with GitHub.</p>
          <p>Part two of this process is to go into Windows Credential Manager and remove
            the github.com auto login credentials.</p>
          <p>Click the start menu button and type "Windows Credential" and you will see
            the link to this appear in the start menu. Click on that link and you will see
            something like this</p>
          <img src="images/windows-credential-manager.png"
            alt="Windows Credential Manager">
          <p>Find the entry for github.com, then click on the arrow button on the right
            side then select the option REMOVE. This will remove that from Windows
            Credential Manager.</p>
          <p>The next set is to logout of the user account in VSCode. You do that by
            clicking on the PRofiles icon and then highlight the name and then clicking on
            Sign Out for that user.</p>
          <img src="images/vscode-sign-out.png" alt="Sing out option in VSCode">
          <p>Restart VSCode and then try and publish the repository again.</p>
          <p>This occurs when Git is installed and told to use the Windows Credential
            Manager and not the Git Credential Manager Core option which is the new
            default. It may be worth reinstalling Git and make sure that the Git
            Credential Manager Core option is selected as in this image.</p>

        <summary>GitHub Pages does not initialize</summary>
        <p> There is an issue where the GitHub pages do not initialize the first time.
          This means
          you must re-initialize a push to GitHub and then recreate the pages setup. </p>
        <ol>

          <li>
            <p>Go to VSCode and push to GitHub</p>

              mark. That means it is complete. The red circle with an X means that it
              failed. </p>
            <img src="images/github-actions-list.png" alt="Github Actions List">
            <p> You will notice that the process will take longer than 1 minute. This is
              due to some
              change GitHub has made on the server due to new features that are being
              added. Even
              publishing the push/sync from VSCode takes as long as 5 min on very busy
              days. </p>
            <p> If the user gets a failed again, check the spelling of the folders and
              file names.
              This process seems to fail if the user has spaces in the folder and
              filenames and
              sometimes if there are underscores in these names. </p>

        <p> There are a few reasons as to why this will occur. There are a couple of

        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p> Open a terminal/command window and try to push to GitHub using the command

            <p> You may get an error that says something like this (It will look different

                                Please specify which branch you want to merge with.<br>
                                See git-pull(1) for details<br><br>
                                git push &lt;remote&gt;  &lt;branch&gt;<br><br>
                                If you wish to set tracking information for this branch you can do so with:<br><br>
                                git push --set-upstream origin master
                            </pre>
            <p> If you get that error at the command line type in the command </p>
            <pre>git push &minus;set-upstream origin master</pre>
            <p>Then do a git push command</p>
            <p>You may be prompted to authenticate with GitHub again.</p>
            <p> Once the push/sync is complete, you will need to restart VSCode and the
              GitHub
              controls within VSCode should work again. </p>
          </li>
          <li> The other reasons why this process will hang are too numerous and hard to
            give
            instructions on how to overcome in this document. This will require more
            research with
            debug logs to see if there is a reason for the hang. </li>

        <p> The instructions to fix this are specific to the version of Windows that is
          being run.
          Here are the basic steps: <a
            href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/allow-an-app-to-access-controlled-folders-b5b6627a-b008-2ca2-7931-7e51e912b034">

          </a>
        </p>
        <h3>Use controlled folder access</h3>
        <p> Controlled folder access in Windows Security reviews the apps that can make
          changes to
          files in protected folders and block unauthorized or unsafe apps from accessing
          or
          changing files in those folders. </p>

          <li> Select <span class="bolded"> Start> Settings> Update &amp; Security>
              Windows
              Security> Virus &amp; threat protection. </span>
          </li>
          <li> Under <span class="bolded">Virus &amp; threat protection</span> settings,
            select
            <span class="bolded">Manage settings</span> .

          <li> Switch the <span class="bolded">Controlled folder access</span> setting to
            <span class="bolded">On</span> or <span class="bolded">Off</span> .
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p> There is an option to allow just one program to run in this Controlled Folder
          Access and
          you can select git.exe from the recently blocked programs. </p>

        <p><span class="bold-text">Mac Computers</span> Apple suppies the version of Git
          to run
          through the XCode software. You must check for software updates for your Mac and
          install
          those updates. This is done through the App Store on the Mac. It is a good idea
          to install
          all those updates on a regular basis. You can get all the instructions for Mac

          correctly,
          you should only need to use your package manager and run the updated command to

        <p>User is prompted to configure formatter</p>
        <p>If the user installs the Prettier extension, which is not needed, the first
          time they go
          to format the code, they will be prompted to select a formatter for that type of
          file type
          (HTML or CSS). VSCode as a code formatter built into the editor that works well
          with HTML,
          CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. </p>
        <img src="images/formatters-configure.png" alt="Choose Formatter">
        <p>One of the issues with the Prettier formatter is that is closes null tags. What
          this
          means is that tags such as the img tag will be closed with /> at the end. This
          is XHTML
          syntax and not part of HTML5 standards.</p>
        <p>Prettier is what is knows as an Opinionated Formatter. It is opinionated in
          that the
          creators of it are stating what they believe is the best way to format something
          even if
          it goes against the standards or not explicitly stated that this is the way it
          must be
          done. They do not give you the option to turn that off. VSCode setting does give
          you that
          option. </p>
