        <p> This has to do with how Git is configured with GPG signing process. This is an issue on
          Windows computers, as the GPG implementation is weird. </p>
        <p> There are a few potential ways to fix this issue. I would recommend turning off the
          signing with GPG. </p>
        <p>Here are the steps to disable this option</p>
        <p>Go to VSCode preferences - Settings</p>
        <img src="images/gpg-1.png" alt="GPG error steps 1">
        <p> Type this into the search bar at the top to find the setting: gpg commit </p>
        <img src="images/gpg-2.png" alt="GPG error step 2">
        <p> Make sure this option is not checked. This is the option that tells VSCode to use PGP
          while pushing to GitHub: Enables commit signing with GPG or X.509 </p>

        <summary>You don&apos;t have permission to push to &lt;GitHub Account&gt; on GitHub
        </summary>
        <p>This error occurs when you have GitHub setup on one account and you try to use another
          account and GitHub auto logs you into the old account with VSCode. </p>
        <img src="images/git-error-push-github.png" alt="Git Error no authorization">
        <p>This error is because Git was previously configured for another user account on the
          computer using the global settings. There are a a few solutions.</p>
        <details>
          <summary>Potentially Destructive and Permanent method</summary>
          <p>Only use this method if the computer was used by someone else and now a new person is
            using the computer and both people are available to do this. This is also a method to
            reset or reconfigure the user on the same computer due to corruption.</p>
          <p>Go to GitHub and log into the old account and click on the user profile picture in the
            top right of the web page. <span class="menu-select"> Select Settings</span> </p>
          <p> On the left navigation menu, select <span class="menu-select">Password and

          <p>This will force VSCode to re-authenticate with GitHub.</p>
          <p> If this is not a possibility and you must have two GitHub accounts with VSCode You
            have to go through an elaborate setup with an extensions and that is listed below. </p>
          <p> There are other authentication methods, but they are much more complex to setup and
            require installation of additional software to create SSH keys for unique encryption
            process and authentication. </p>

          <summary>Preferred Method</summary>
          <p> Make sure each student is using a different system Account to log into the computer.
            This is not always possible, but the preferred method and easiest. Some families do not
            allow this, one reason is so people do not have the temptation of going to inappropriate
            sites because everyone else in the family will see where they went. </p>
          <p> This web page explains the various locations that the config files may be found in
            Windows: <a
              href="https://www.onwebsecurity.com/configuration/git-on-windows-location-of-global-configuration-file.html"
              target="_blank">On Web Security</a>. The first command on this page</p>
          <pre class="code-style">git config --list –show-origin</pre>
          <p>will show you where the config files are located. If you run this in a folder that is
            part of a repository you will see the global and repository locations. If run outside of
            a repository, it will show only the global config.</p>
          <p> <span class="bold-text">Windows</span>: The reason for the different Profiles/Accounts
            on the computer is that git should store the config for that profile in a hidden file in
            the <span class="bold-text">%USERPROFILE%\.gitconfig</span> file. The <span
              class="bold-text">%userprofile%</span> is usually in the <span
              class="bold-text">c:\users\username</span> folder depending on who is logged in. This
            does not always work as the location of the .config file may be found in a shared area
            of the system. That is why you should run the command above to see where the global
            config is located.</p>
          <p> <span class="bold-text">Mac / Linux</span>system stores the file in the HOME folder
            for the user by default in a hidden file called <span
              class="bolded-text">.gitconfig</span> and is much more reliable than Windows for the
            location. </p>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>Manual method</summary>
          <p>Do not use the <span class="bold-text">git config --global</span> command. The student
            must set the username and email for each repository. To do this they will have to edit
            the <span class="bold-text">.git/config</span> file for each repository and add the
            correct entries or run the git config commands in the repository directory after the git
            init command and do not use the global option.</p>
          <pre
            class="colde-style">git config --global user.email "email"<br>git config --global user.name "github username"</pre>
          <p>That will set the username and email address per repository in each <span
              class="bold-text">.git/config</span> file. </p>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>Use VSCode Extension</summary>
          <p>Install a VSCode extension that will do this for you: “Git Config User Profiles” Here

          <p>This extension does the configuring of the username and email address in each

            switch too.</p>

        <summary>GitHub Pages does not initialize</summary>
        <p> There is an issue where the GitHub pages do not initialize the first time. This means
          you must re-initialize a push to GitHub and then recreate the pages setup. </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>Go to the pages setup page and change the branch to NONE</p>

            <p> Watch the top entry until the icon to the left turns blue or green with a check
              mark. That means it is complete. The red circle with an X means that it failed. </p>

            <p> You will notice that the process will take longer than 1 minute. This is due to some
              change GitHub has made on the server due to new features that are being added. Even
              publishing the push/sync from VSCode takes as long as 5 min on very busy days. </p>
            <p> If the user gets a failed again, check the spelling of the folders and file names.
              This process seems to fail if the user has spaces in the folder and filenames and
              sometimes if there are underscores in these names. </p>

        <summary> VSCode push/sync to GitHub seems to hang and not do anything </summary>
        <p> There are a few reasons as to why this will occur. There are a couple of things to try.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p> Open a terminal/command window and try to push to GitHub using the command line </p>
            <pre>git push</pre>
            <p> You may get an error that says something like this (It will look different on the
              various OS&apos;s): </p>
            <pre>
                                There is no tracking information for the current branch.<br>
                                Please specify which branch you want to merge with.<br>
                                See git-pull(1) for details<br><br>
                                git push &lt;remote&gt;  &lt;branch&gt;<br><br>
                                If you wish to set tracking information for this branch you can do so with:<br><br>
                                git push --set-upstream origin master
                            </pre>
            <p> If you get that error at the command line type in the command </p>
            <pre>git push &minus;set-upstream origin master</pre>
            <p>Then do a git push command</p>
            <p>You may be prompted to authenticate with GitHub again.</p>
            <p> Once the push/sync is complete, you will need to restart VSCode and the GitHub
              controls within VSCode should work again. </p>
          </li>
          <li> The other reasons why this process will hang are too numerous and hard to give
            instructions on how to overcome in this document. This will require more research with
            debug logs to see if there is a reason for the hang. </li>

          following Windows System error </p>
        <img src="images/windows-unathorixed-change.jpg" alt="Windows Security Issue">
        <p> The instructions to fix this are specific to the version of Windows that is being run.
          Here are the basic steps: <a
            href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/allow-an-app-to-access-controlled-folders-b5b6627a-b008-2ca2-7931-7e51e912b034">

          </a>
        </p>
        <h3>Use controlled folder access</h3>
        <p> Controlled folder access in Windows Security reviews the apps that can make changes to
          files in protected folders and block unauthorized or unsafe apps from accessing or
          changing files in those folders. </p>
        <ol>
          <li> Select <span class="bolded"> Start> Settings> Update &amp; Security> Windows
              Security> Virus &amp; threat protection. </span>
          </li>
          <li> Under <span class="bolded">Virus &amp; threat protection</span> settings, select
            <span class="bolded">Manage settings</span> . </li>
          <li> Under <span class="bolded">Controlled folder access</span> , select <span
              class="bolded">Manage Controlled folder access</span> . </li>
          <li> Switch the <span class="bolded">Controlled folder access</span> setting to <span
              class="bolded">On</span> or <span class="bolded">Off</span> . </li>
        </ol>
        <p> There is an option to allow just one program to run in this Controlled Folder Access and
          you can select git.exe from the recently blocked programs. </p>
        <p> If you look at the Windows Notifications, you may see an error like this. </p>
        <img src="images/windows-unathorixed-change-2.jpg"
          alt="Windows Notification Controlled Access">
        <p> This is the same step as above for the same error. Microsoft has a few diverse ways to
          present this message. It will also be logged in to the System Logs. </p>

        <p> The reason for this error is that the code on GitHub was edited and the user did not
          issue a git pull command before making any changes to their local machine before they
          started to edit on the local machine. </p>
        <p>To fix this error there are a few options.</p>
        <ol>
          <li> The first and usually the easiest for those new to Git/GitHub is to recreate the
            repository. You have to unpublish the site, delete the repository, delete the .git
            folder on the local and then push back to a Public Repository on GitHub. </li>
          <li>
            <p> The preferred way is to stash the changes, pull from the server, merge your stashed
              changes into the update from the server and then push back to the server. </p>
            <p>Run these commands:</p>
            <pre>
                                git stash<br>
                                git pull<br>
                                git stash pop &lt;&minus; This will apply your saved changes<br>
                                git commit -m “message”<br>
                                git push<br>
                                git stash clear &lt;&minus; This will remove the stashed files from memory. Stashed files stay until removed.<br>
                            </pre>
          </li>
          <li> You can try and issue a &apos;git push -f&apos; command at the command line and see
            it will go through. This is still not a guarantee that it will push. </li>
          <li>
            <p> You can create a new branch and push to the new brach. You can then go to the fork
              and use the built in process on GitHub to validate the change in the fork and merge
              back to the master/main branch. (This is the way most companies do development) </p>

        <p>User is prompted to configure formatter</p>
        <p>If the user installs the Prettier extension, which is not needed, the first time they go
          to format the code, they will be prompted to select a formatter for that type of file type
          (HTML or CSS). VSCode as a code formatter built into the editor that works well with HTML,
          CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. </p>
        <img src="images/formatters-configure.png" alt="Choose Formatter">
        <p>One of the issues with the Prettier formatter is that is closes null tags. What this
          means is that tags such as the img tag will be closed with /> at the end. This is XHTML
          syntax and not part of HTML5 standards.</p>
        <p>Prettier is what is knows as an Opinionated Formatter. It is opinionated in that the
          creators of it are stating what they believe is the best way to format something even if
          it goes against the standards or not explicitly stated that this is the way it must be
          done. They do not give you the option to turn that off. VSCode setting does give you that
          option. </p>
