        <h2><span style="color: #050b77;"><strong>You have made it to the end of the
                                class.</strong></span></h2>
        <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Class officially ends on June 18, and the last
                        day to submit assignments is June 19 @ 11:59 PM UTC. The course
                        will auto lock on this day, and you will not be allowed to submit
                        any more. This is set by the school, not me.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">You have to take your final exam by this date,
                        or you will get a ZERO.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">If you have any personal questions or personal
                        issues, please make sure to send me an e-mail.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Questions about the course and the course
                        material need to be posted in Microsoft Teams Help Channel. I do
                        respond to those as quickly as I can.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <h3><span style="color: #d70505;"><strong>Microsoft Teams</strong></span></h3>
        <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I posted a lot of helpful hints and examples in
                        the Random Help channel. Other instructors will be doing the same
                        thing so get used to looking for that type of information. There
                        are currently 16 courses in development that uses Teams for the
                        class communications, and more are being added almost every
                        semester.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Remember that Zoom is used by all classes, and
                        you must have that installed on your computer. Some course will
                        require you to hold zoom meetings with other students and record
                        the meeting and submit the recording for grading. You must be
                        using your school login for those meetings so that they can last
                        longer than 45 minutes. Most of those meetings with other students
                        will last 60 to 90 minutes.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">You will have access to the Microsoft Teams Team
                        WDD130 for 1 year, so you can access all the examples all the
                        information in all the channels and save anything that you want to
                        keep. Remember that there are quite a few examples I posted in
                        there to help you with some of your styling.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Teams is also a way you can communicate with
                        classmates using the chat feature. The chat feature is available
                        all the time to all BYU-Idaho students.</span></p>
        <h3><strong><span style="color: #d70505;">Final Grades</span></strong></h3>
        <p><span style="color: #ba372a; font-size: 14pt;">Just a reminder that if this is
                        a required course for your certificate or degree, you must earn a
                        C- or higher for it to count. If you do not get at least that
                        grade, you will have to retake the course. Please reach out to
                        your mentor for more information about this and guidance.</span>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Good luck with other courses and it has been a
                        pleasure to be your instructor.</span></p>
