  <h2><span style="color: #0d087e;"><strong>Activities</strong></span></h2>
  <p>This week you will read a talk from Elder Uchtdorf.&nbsp; This is an article to help
    you think about sharing the gospel online. You will have a few questions to answer</p>
  <p>You will then be learning about the <strong><span style="color: #ba372a;">HTML table
        element</span></strong>. This table tag is one that used to be used for all web
    page layouts in the 1994 to 1997 time of the web. It was the only way to get half
    decent looking page layouts. Back then there were very few graphics being used in the
    HTML.</p>
  <p>You will then learn about creating <strong><span style="color: #ba372a;">HTML
        forms</span></strong>. Forms are used anytime you have to get input from the user.
    Every website has at least 1 form on the site. A simple login page, registration page,
    sign-up for a newsletter, contact us page are all example of the use of the form tag.
  </p>
  <p>You will then <span style="color: #ba372a;"><strong>learn about styling the
        forms</strong></span>. Styling forms is very important. You will learn about the
    styling for input layouts. In future classes you will also learn to style display
    forms. The way you style the is different.</p>
  <h2><span style="color: #0d087e;"><strong>Code Along Activity</strong></span></h2>
  <p><span style="color: #ba372a;"><strong>You will then create a quiz
        form</strong></span>. This is a very basic way that you can create questions and
    input for a quiz. You will not be processing the quiz in this class as that is for a
    future class once you have learned JavaScript as well. Again the video will be posted
    on Wednesday, October 1 in Microsoft Teams</p>
  <h2><span style="color: #0d087e;"><strong>Submitted Work</strong></span></h2>
  <p><span style="color: #ba372a;"><strong>You will create the Contact Us page for the
        Rafting Site</strong></span>. Make sure to pay close attention to how this is
    done. You will make a copy of the About Us file and then remove the contents from the
    &lt;main&gt; area and then recreate that content.</p>
  <p>The grading will be done with the Page Audit Tools and the Rubric on teh Submission
    page.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Remember that the title tag is not allowed to be the same as any other page of a
    website and the description must describe what the page is about. Search engines such
    as Google use that description to display in the results. Google will not show
    multiple pages with the same title and/or description on the page. That is a big
    reason why they must be different.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Here is the &lt;title&gt; &amp; &lt;meta name="description"&gt; tag from a website I
    redesigned. This is the old title and description</p>
  <p><img
      src="//rborcherds.github.io/wdd130-instructor/announcements/images/dev-tools-title-desc.png"
      alt="dev tools image" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Here is the Google Search Results from the old title and description. You will notice
    that the description above is the exact same in the image below with the description
    and the text from the &lt;title&gt; tag.</p>
