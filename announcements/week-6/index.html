    <h2>End of Semester</h2>
    <p
        style="font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', system-ui, 'Apple Color Emoji', 'Segoe UI Emoji', 'Segoe UI Web', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; white-space: normal;">
        <span style="font-size: 14pt;"><span style="color: #b6424c;"><strong><span
                        style="color: #050b77;">Final Project is due on Saturday, December
                        6, 2025,</span> with last day to submit late work Thursday,
                    December 11, 2025, 11:59 PM UTC.</strong></span></span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Nothing can be submitted after this date. There are
            no exceptions to this.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">The final exam opens this week. <strong>DO NOT OPEN
                the exam until you are ready to take it</strong>. You only get 1 chance
            and it is times. You have 75 minutes to finish it.</span></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h3><span style="color: #0d7b05;"><strong>What you will be doing for Week
                6.</strong></span></h3>
    <p>You have to submit the final 2 pages of your rafting website.</p>
    <p>You will study the <strong>Web Developer Road-map</strong> and the <strong>Web
            Designer Road-map </strong>and learn what it takes to do both jobs. You will
        also learn about interview questions for the Web Designer</p>
    <p>The font-end road-map has a lot of information on it. This is very subjective and
        personal choice. It does give a great overview of most of the optional languages,
        skills etc. that you will need to learn to be successful as a web front-end
        developer.</p>
    <p>The Web Designer has a section about building your portfolio to showcase your work.
    </p>
    <p><strong>You will do some research on potential jobs</strong> that you will be able
        to do including how to find an internship and post about it in the Week 06 Forum
        Channel in Teams.</p>
    <p><span>The rest of week 6 will be spent on building the last 2 pages of your
            website. You will build the trips page and the home page. Make sure to go back
            and fix issues from weeks 3 to 5 as things such as the title, meta
            description, color contrast, etc. will be verified on all pages. HTML and CSS
            errors must be fixed for all pages as well. Those will affect your Week 6
            grade.</span></p>
    <p><span>One very important piece of knowledge for week 6. <strong>Submit before the
                end of the week so you have a chance to resubmit for a higher
                grade.</strong> If you submit on Saturday and into week 7, there is a very
            high chance that you will not get the opportunity to resubmit as the class
            will lock on Thursday, October 16 at 11:59 PM UTC.</span></p>

    <h3><span style="color: #780872;"><strong>Spiritual Thought/Question</strong></span>
    </h3>
    <p>President Nelson has made some very interesting comments since becoming prophet.
        One such comment that he has made a couple of time in General Conference is:&nbsp;
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><span>I plead with you to increase your spiritual capacity to receive
                revelation. - April 2018 General Conference "Revelation for the Church,
                Revelation for Our Lives"</span></p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <p>I renew my plea for you to do whatever it takes to increase your spiritual
            capacity to receive personal revelation. - April 2020 General Conference "Hear
            Him"</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>What does these statements mean to you and how can you accomplish this?</p>
