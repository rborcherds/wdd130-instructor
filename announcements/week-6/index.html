        <span style="font-size: 14pt;"><span style="color: #b6424c;"><strong><span
                        style="color: #050b77;">Final Project is due on Saturday, August
                        9,</span> with last day to submit late work Thursday, August 14,
                    11:59 PM UTC.</strong></span></span>
    </p>
    <p>Nothing can be submitted after this date. There are no exceptions to this.</p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">The final exam opens this week. DO NOT OPEN the exam
            until you are ready to take it. You only get 1 chance and it is times. You
            have 75 minutes to finish it.</span></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h3><span style="color: #0d7b05;"><strong>What you will be doing for Week
                6.</strong></span></h3>
    <p>You have to submit the final 2 pages of your rafting website.</p>
    <p>You will study the <strong>Web Developer Road-map</strong> and the <strong>Web
            Designer Road-map </strong>and learn what it takes to do both jobs. You will
        also learn about interview questions for the Web Designer</p>
    <p>The font-end road-map has a lot of information on it. This is very subjective and
        personal choice. It does give a great overview of most of the optional languages,
        skills etc. that you will need to learn to be successful as a web front-end
        developer.</p>
    <p>The Web Designer has a section about building your portfolio to showcase your work.
    </p>
    <p>You will do some research on potential jobs that you will be able to do including
        how to find an internship and post about it in the General Channel in Teams.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The rest of week 6 will be spent on building the last 2 pages of your website. You
        will build the trips page and the home page.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h3><span style="color: #780872;"><strong>Spiritual Thought/Question</strong></span>
    </h3>
    <p>As we come to the end of this course, are there any spiritual questions that have
        come up doing the semester that you would like to find an answer to? Post the
        question if Teams in the Spiritual Thought Channel and let's help each other learn
        about that topic.</p>
