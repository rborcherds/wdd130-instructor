<body>
   <p>
      <span style="font-size: 14pt;">Everyone will work on the same website the
         first 10 weeks. It is a fictitious river running company. You will get
         to do your own site starting in week 5. No exceptions to this.</span>
   </p>
   <p>&nbsp;</p>
   <p>
      <span style="font-size: 14pt;"><span style="color: #d70505;"><strong>YOU
               MUST KNOW THIS INFO:</strong></span><br></span>
   </p>
   <p>
      <span style="font-size: 14pt;"> You will be asked for the class section
         number. To find this click on PEOPLE in the left menu and it has the
         section number next to all the students names in this class. This
         number is required for the site plans and the footer of all web pages
         you create in this class as part of the copyright notice.</span>
   </p>
   <p>&nbsp;</p>
   <h3><strong>Now onto this week. </strong></h3>
   <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"> You should start by doing the preparation
         videos and/or reading assignment and quiz first. Preferably at the
         start of the week. This will prepare you for the weeks work.</span></p>
   <p>&nbsp;</p>
   <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">You will setup your hosting this week using
         Git and GitHub. You must follow the instructions exactly for your
         operating system. If you run into issue you must post the error you are
         getting into the Discussion Forum so everyone can learn how to fix
         issues. I recommend that you use your own personal e-mail address when
         you create your GitHub account. This is something that you will use as
         a developer your entire career. </span></p>
   <p>&nbsp;</p>
   <p><span style="font-size: 14pt">You must do the practice assignment even
         though you do not get graded on this. This practice assignment will
         style the homepage you created in the Setting up your Git and GitHub
         repository instructions for your GitHub Hosting. You can see an example
         of this formatting at: <a
            href="//rborcherds.github.io/wdd130-instructor/">//rborcherds.github.io/wdd130-instructor/</a></span>
   </p>

   <p>
      <strong><span style="color: #060878; font-size: 14pt;"> Starting this
            week</span></strong>
      <span style="color: #060878; font-size: 14pt;">, all the assignments will
         build upon each other.</span> <span
         style="color: #c9211e; font-size: 14pt;"><strong>All
            students</strong></span>
      <span style="color: unset; font-size:14pt;"><strong> build the same
            fictitious company website, Dry Oar</strong>. You will need to
         complete each weeks work to be able to do the next weeks work. This is
         the first project that lasts till week 9. Every item under each Module
         has to have a green check mark on the right side to open the next
         week.</span>
   </p>
   <p>
      <span style="font-size: 14pt;">You will continue learning HTML to add to
         the site and you will start to learn about CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
         each week. </span>
   </p>
   <p>
      <span style="font-size: 14pt;">You will be introduced too "Site Plans"
         this week. Site plans are a document that should be created before any
         web page is created so that you can keep a consistent look and feel to
         the page. It also describes the type of images, voice, colors, text of
         the site, etc of the web site. </span>
   </p>
   <p>
      <span style="font-size: 14pt;">In the instructions have steps specific for
         Windows, MAC or Linux machines. If you do not understand what are in
         the instructions try this page: <a
            href="https://github.com/git-guides/install-git#install-git-on-linux"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener">https://github.com/git-guides/install-git#install-git-on-linux</a></span>
   </p>
   <p>
      <span style="font-size: 14pt;">You will create a homepage that has links
         to the About Me page, the Dry Oar website, the Dry Oar Site Plan site,
         and an activity called Positioning with 2 blank links for use in week
         7</span>
   </p>
   <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Once you create the homepage you will
         publish it to GitHub.</span></p>
   <p>
      <span style="font-size: 14pt;">You will then create the site-plan and the
         CSS file for the site-plan. Make sure you follow the instructions
         carefully. A lot of students to do not pay attention to the details and
         miss points because of the minor details. Make sure you modify all the
         correct CSS and HTML areas.</span>
   </p>
   <p>&nbsp;</p>
   <h2>Spiritual Thought/Question for the Week</h2>
   <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Take a scripture do want to learn more
         about.</span></p>
   <p>
      <span style="font-size: 14pt;">Go to the Citation Index website that BYU
         Provo maintains at <a href="https://scriptures.byu.edu/" target="_blank"
            rel="noopener">https://scriptures.byu.edu</a></span>
   </p>
   <p>
      <span style="font-size: 14pt;">This site is split into 3 sections. The
         left side is all the scriptures showing the King James Version and the
         Joseph Smith Translation of the Old and New Testament along with the
         Book of Mormon, Doctrine &amp; Covenants and the Pearl of Great Price.
         The middle section is where the text of the talks I am asking you to
         lookup will be displayed. When you first open the website this part of
         the web page gives you important information. The right side is the
         citation index where you will lookup the scripture you want to learn
         more about. There is a Spanish version at <a href="https://escrituras.byu.edu"
            target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://escrituras.byu.edu</a>.<br></span>
   </p>
   <p>&nbsp;</p>
   <ul>
      <li>
         <span style="font-size: 14pt;">Using the navigation on the right site
            of the web page, find the scripture you want to learn more about and
            click on it. Some versus will be in multiple sections as part of a
            set of versus or an individual one.</span>
      </li>
      <li>
         <span style="font-size: 14pt;">Select a talk that is being displayed
            and read the section of the talk where that scripture is referenced.
            You many need to read one or two paragraphs before and/or after to
            get the full meaning.</span>
      </li>
      <li>
         <span style="font-size: 14pt;">If you feel so inclined, post what you
            learned about the scripture you looked up and what you
            learned.<br></span>
      </li>
   </ul>
   <p>
      <span style="font-size: 14pt;">This is a great activity to do as a Family
         Home Evening lesson if you have older children or just adults as in a
         YSA Ward.</span>
