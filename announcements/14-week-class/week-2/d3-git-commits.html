  <p> The question has come up as to what to type into the git commit message
    area. </p>
  <p>Before I get into the best practice, I want to explain a few things.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> 1.&nbsp; The process to commit and sync with GitHub is a multiple step
    procedure. </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Commit to staged status&nbsp;&nbsp; (git commit -m "message")</li>
    <li> Send staged to Github via a push command or a sync command&nbsp; (git
      push origin &lt;branch name on GitHub&gt;&nbsp; Most of you will have
      either the branch name as MASTER or MAIN on GitHub. </li>
    <li> Pull any changes from GitHub to local computer. (git pull &lt;remote
      branch name&gt;) </li>
  </ul>
  <p> You can do all these commands at the same time by doing a Commit &amp;
    Sync (git sync origin &lt;remote branch&gt;). In VSCode this is done by
    click the blue button if it sayd Commit &amp; Sync or click the down arrow
    on the right side of the button and select commit &amp; sync </p>
  <p>

  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> 2.&nbsp; There is a box to type a message in before you hit the
    commit/commit &amp; sync button. This screenshot shows the commit &amp; sync
    as one button. Most of you will only have COMMIT button. </p>
  <p>

      alt="commit &amp; sync button">
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> If you hit the commit button without a message, you will get an editor
    screen that looks something like this image. You have to type a message into
    line 1. You must save and close this editor screen for the commit process to
    continue. </p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>3. What to type in the MESSAGE box.</p>
  <p> This is limited to 50 characters in length. The best commit messages
    follow the guidelines from this article: <a

  </p>
  <p>Basically it is this type of message</p>
  <pre><code>Write your commit message in the imperative: "Fix bug" and not "Fixed
    bug" or "Fixes bug." This convention matches up with commit messages
    generated by commands like git merge and git revert.</code></pre>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>From that page mentioned. There are 2 types of messages.</p>
  <pre><span style="font-size: 14pt;">
      <strong>Rules for a great git commit message style</strong></span>
   </pre>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <pre>Separate subject from body with a blank line</pre>
    </li>
    <li>
      <pre>Do not end the subject line with a period</pre>
    </li>
    <li>
      <pre>Capitalize the subject line and each paragraph</pre>
    </li>
    <li>
      <pre>Use the imperative mood in the subject line</pre>
    </li>
    <li>
      <pre>Wrap lines at 72 characters</pre>
    </li>
    <li>
      <pre>
Use the body to explain what and why you have done something. In most cases, you can leave out details about how a change has been made.</pre>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <pre><a id="user-content-information-in-commit-messages" class="anchor" href="https://gist.github.com/robertpainsi/b632364184e70900af4ab688decf6f53#information-in-commit-messages" aria-hidden="true"></a><b><b><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Information in commit messages</span></strong></pre>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <pre>Describe why a change is being made.</pre>
    </li>
    <li>
      <pre>How does it address the issue?</pre>
    </li>
    <li>
      <pre>What effects does the patch have?</pre>
    </li>
    <li>
      <pre>
Do not assume the reviewer understands what the original problem was.</pre>
    </li>
    <li>
      <pre>Do not assume the code is self-evident/self-documenting.</pre>
    </li>
    <li>
      <pre>
Read the commit message to see if it hints at improved code structure.</pre>
    </li>
    <li>
      <pre>The first commit line is the most important.</pre>
    </li>
    <li>
      <pre>Describe any limitations of the current code.</pre>
    </li>
    <li>
      <pre>Do not include patch set-specific comments.</pre>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p> If you want to add more data than the main message line, which is line 1
    of the text, you hit the commit button and then in the editor screen add you
    message and then go below what is there and enter additional info. Remember
    to keep is as short as possible. Every one on the internet can read that
    info if they so wish.&nbsp; This screenshot gives you and example of that.
    The arrow pointing to the vertical line is the max width or characters
    allowed. The arrow at the bottom shows and additional message added. </p>

  <p> There is a lot more info that can be given on this topic but I will leave
    that up to you to research and read if you so wish. This is just the info
    you need to get started. </p>

  <p> To read commit messages and to look at what changes have been made. Open a
    repo, click on the commits. The number next to the word will be different
    for each repo </p>

  <p> You will see a screen like this one. Click on the little box with the 3
    dots and you will see the additional message </p>

  <p> In the image above you will notice an orange dot. That means the
    publication to the GitHub Pages is running. The check mark means that commit
    was successful. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> In this next image it shows the additional message and it has a red X in
    it meaning the publication to GitHub Pages failed. </p>
