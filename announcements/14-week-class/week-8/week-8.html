  <h2><span style="color: #081470;">What to expect</span></h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You will finish the second page for the rafting site. You have to come up
      with the content.</li>
    <li>You will be writing all the content for your personal site this week. This
      includes at least 2 image on every page.</li>
    <li>This weeks <strong>Challenge</strong> activity is to teach you how to
      optimize images for the web.</li>
    <li>You have an <strong>Wireframe Assignment </strong>that you have to submit.
      This wireframe is for the second page of the river rafting site. You must
      submit this wireframe as part of the site-plan for the rafting site. This
      means you must save the wireframe as an image. This will not be accepted any
      other way.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2><span style="color: #081470;">Finishing Dry Oar Website</span></h2>
  <p>This week you will create the wireframe for page 2 and week 9 you will that
    finished paged fully coded and styled. Week 10 you will create the Contact Us
    page. All that code will be given to you.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2><span style="color: #081470;">Wireframes</span></h2>
  <p>As you get into doing more design work for websites and even for other types
    of software, you will have to learn how to use wireframing software. Here is a
    list of the best 9 software that have free trials or are completely free for
    small projects <a

  <h2><span style="color: #081470;">Personal Site Content</span></h2>
  <p>This week you will be writing all the content for your personal site. You
    will also be finding images for your site. Make sure you follow the
    instructions on these two items carefully.</p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Significant content</strong>. This generally means at least 300
      words of content for each page. The more the better as it will give you more
      options on what you can place on your web pages.</li>
    <li><strong>Images</strong>. Make sure at least one image per page relate to
      the topic of that page. I will be randomly checking to make sure none of the
      images are copyrighted. This issue of using copyrighted images is of big
      concern for students. You will learn some of the legalities of this issue in
      a few classes. You will have to take a law class to learn all the aspects of
      this issue. Just be aware that copyright infringement could cost you
      thousands to millions of dollars to settle. Just better not do it.</li>
    <li><strong>Free image sites</strong>. I give you this warning about using
      these sites. I use them a lot and this is from experience. A lot of them
      will have images that are not conducive to the teachings of the church.
      There is a lot of nudity on some of them. Just be aware and be cautious.
      There are hundreds of them on the internet with some free content and a lot
      of paid content. Most free sites will require you to sign-up with them to be
      able to download the images. Do not use your BYU-I email address for these
      sites.</li>
    <li>All the text and optimized images must be added to the site plan and
      submitted.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2><span style="color: #081470;">Starting week 11 and preparing for end of
      semester</span></h2>
  <p>I will not be accepting any of the Dry Oar submissions from the start of week
    11. Everything should be turned from the first 8 weeks and you should be well
    on your way into your personal site.</p>
  <p>Reminder that all work that will be graded must be turned in by Wednesday Dec
    13. Final Grades are submitted by Wednesday, Dec 20 and you can see your final
    grade on Thursday Dec 21.</p>

  <h2><span style="color: #081470;">Spiritual Challenge</span></h2>

    Handbook of Instruction, Chapter 26, section 26.3.3.1</p>

  </p>
  <p>These are the first 4 questions.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Do you have faith in and a testimony of God, the Eternal Father; His Son,
      Jesus Christ; and the Holy Ghost?</li>
    <li>Do you have a testimony of the Atonement of Jesus Christ and of His role
      as your Savior and Redeemer?</li>
    <li>Do you have a testimony of the Restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ?
    </li>
    <li>Do you sustain the President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
      Saints as the prophet, seer, and revelator and as the only person on the
      earth authorized to exercise all priesthood keys?<br />Do you sustain the
      members of the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles as
      prophets, seers, and revelators?<br />Do you sustain the other General
      Authorities and local leaders of the Church?</li>
  </ol>
  <h3><span style="color: #dd0d0d;">The discussion this week is:</span></h3>
  <p>What is your understanding of these questions in your life? How do you know
    if you have faith, testimony, or sustain as these questions ask?</p>
