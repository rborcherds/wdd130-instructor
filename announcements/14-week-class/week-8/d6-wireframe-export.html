  <p> Quite a few of you have had a hard time exporting your wireframes to
    images.&nbsp; </p>
  <p> Here are the URL's to the export instructions for the 3 sites in the
    instructions. Remember that they must be in image format only so you can add
    them to the site plan. </p>

  <p> This one is a premium feature meaning you have to pay to use this feature
    if you are outside the 7 day free premium trial. </p>

  </p>
  <p> If you want to use this site, sign-up for the 7 day free trial near the
    end of week 8 and create the wireframe for Week 8 and then create the 3
    wireframes for week 9 that are required for your personal site. </p>
  <p> I would recommend using the screenshot browser utilities or the snip-it
    tools mentioned in the announcement in week 1 to get this screenshot. </p>
