  <h2>

      <strong>YOU MUST WRITE THE ACTUAL TEXT OF THE PAGES THIS WEEK</strong>
    </span>
  </h2>
  <p> Quite a few of you are writing what will be on the page. This assignment
    is for you to write the actual content that will be on each page. For web
    developers this is one of the hardest parts. </p>
  <p>There are 2 main reasons for writing the content this week</p>
  <ol>
    <li> Knowing how much text you have will help you design your page layout
      wireframes in week 9 </li>
    <li> Having all the content will speed up the writing of the HTML for ALL 3
      pages in week 10. </li>
  </ol>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> You must have at least 2 images per page and at least one has to relate to
    the content of the page. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>
    <span style="color: #d70505;"> You do not do anything with CSS until week 11
      for your personal site. </span>
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> Week 10 I will be looking for correct HTML semantic markup. There will be
    more info in the Week 10 Welcome Announcement. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> Planning ahead, Week 11 is Thanksgiving week in the USA. For all USA
    students plan ahead. I have already move the Thursday due date to Friday and
    you still have the Saturday due date with the CSS for the homepage due. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Post any questions in the Discussion Forum.</p>
