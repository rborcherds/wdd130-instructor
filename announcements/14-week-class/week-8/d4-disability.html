    <h2>Disability laws</h2>
    <p> There is a law that is not taught in any class specifically for web
      development, but one you must be aware that it does exists. Most new
      developers do not even think about this issue. </p>
    <p> Your website must be usable by people that have color blindness or even
      are totally blind. I want to address the color blindness in this post. The
      blind users issue could be a 3 to 5 week module just on that. </p>
    <p> I posted last week a list of link to various sites that allow you to
      create color schemes. One of these is <a class="external"
        href="https://paletton.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
        <span>https://paletton.com/</span>
      </a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <a class="external" href="https://paletton.com/" target="_blank"
        rel="noopener">
        <span class="external_link_icon" role="presentation">
          <span class="screenreader-only">Links to an external site.</span>
        </span>
      </a> . If you choose your colors with this site, it has a Visual
      Simulation that will show you what people with various color blindness
      will see when looking at your site.
    </p>
    <p> One of the ways to address this is to also make sure that your site has
      good color contrast.&nbsp; Read this article for a lot more info on this
      and why it is important <a class="external"

        target="_blank" rel="noopener">

          <span class="screenreader-only">Links to an external site.</span>
        </span>
      </a>
    </p>
    <p>Here are 2 webistes that will test your contrast colors</p>

    <p> Here is a link to a browser extension that will test the colors on a
      website for you.&nbsp; On the summary page there is an icon fro ARIA. This
      is what is used for screen readers to read the contents of a website to a
      blind person. You can learn about it on your own but I would recommend
      learning about it when you start your first job. It will make a lot more
      sense then. </p>
