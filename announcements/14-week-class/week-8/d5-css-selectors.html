  <h2>CSS Selectors</h2>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> Here is a good explanation for the CSS selectors in a Cheat Sheet type
    format.&nbsp; </p>
  <p>
    <a class="external"
      href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/css-selectors-cheat-sheet/"
      target="_blank" rel="noopener"> CSS Selectors Cheat Sheet </a>
  </p>
  <p>
    <a class="external"
      href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/css-selectors-cheat-sheet/"
      target="_blank" rel="noopener">
      <span> https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/css-selectors-cheat-sheet/
      </span>
    </a>
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> This does not list all the selectors, for example it does not go through
    all the pseudo-class selectors. This URL give you all the
    pseudo-classes&nbsp; that are available. </p>
  <h3> Pseudo-classes <a class="external"
      href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes"
      target="_blank" rel="noopener"></a>
  </h3>
  <p>
    <a class="external"
      href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes"
      target="_blank" rel="noopener">
      <span> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes
      </span>
    </a>
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> By using the attribute selectors you can have a lot more selectors to use.
    For example in the Dry Oar website you can use the following from an alt= of
    and image </p>
  <pre>[alt="running the rapids"] {&nbsp; width: 75%;}</pre>
  <p> This will apply to any image that has the alt="running the rapids"
    description on it. </p>
  <p> Another way to use this is for a href links that open in a new tab such as
    the social media icons in our site. This will only affect links that open in
    a new tab/window. </p>
  <pre>[target="_blank"] {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; box-sizing: border-box;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; padding: 1em;<br>}</pre>
  <p>Let me know if you have any questions.</p>
