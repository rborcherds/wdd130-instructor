    <h3>Portfolio site examples.</h3>
    <p>This first site has a good array of things on the homepage. Just to give
      you some ideas. The Work link is a good example as well. Blog is not
      allowed in this class.<br /><a href="https://timmyomahony.com/"

    <p>This is a good one too with the information but I do not like the layout
      too much<br /><a href="https://ianlunn.co.uk/" target="_blank"

    <p>This is a great layout and a great example of keeping it simple. You do
      not have all the knowledge yet to do this complete layout. The way he has
      his content is an excellent example.<br /><a href="https://sebkay.com/"
        target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://sebkay.com/</a></p>
    <p>This is a 1 page design but can be broken into at least 3 pages for the
      design. Great content and overall layout<br /><a
