  <h2>Getting a screenshot from Codepen</h2>
  <p> The Poem Alignment assignment requires you to use codepen.io to do the
    assignment. Do not use your local machine and publish to GitHub. </p>
  <p> There are two ways to get to a full screen capture of the poem in the
    alignment boxes. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h3><strong>The first way</strong></h3>
  <p> In the bottom there is a button that says FORK. Click on that button. This
    will make a copy of the project into a personal work area that you can save
    it and look at it in full screen mode. </p>
  <p>

  </p>
  <h3><strong>There is a second way.</strong></h3>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> This require the installation of an extension called Capture &amp; Print.
    This will allow you to capture a page and even scroll down the page. </p>
  <p>Click on the extension icon and then select what you want to capture.</p>
  <p> This will make a graphic image of that in a new tab. (You must allow
    pop-ups for this to work) </p>
  <p>You can then right click and select Save Image As.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> Extension for Firefox that works well: &nbsp; <a

  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> Extension for Chrome, Edge, and other Chromium browsers. This is just one
    of many that will work: </p>
