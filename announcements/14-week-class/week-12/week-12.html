  <h2>Week 12</h2>
  <p>
    <span style="font-size: 14pt;">
      <strong>&nbsp;Web Component:</strong> This week you will be creating a web
      component using code from w3schools.com how-to section. This component
      should be something that you can use on your personal site if possible. If
      not then you will have to create a web page just for&nbsp; that component
      and submit that new page or you submit the page from your personal site.
      Keep in mind that a lot of these components are using JavaScript code,
      font-awesome icons, etc that are a little old. There are newer versions of
      the code etc that you can use, but learn that on your own time. Some
      things will take a lot longer for you to update than you will have time to
      accomplish this week. </span>

      <strong>You will submit the first sub-page this week.</strong> Make sure
      it matches what is in the wireframe from your site-plan. <span
        style="color: #0000ff;">
        <em>
          <strong> I will not grade anything from you if the link to the
            site-plan is not in the footer </strong>
        </em>
      </span> . Header and Footer should be the same on all pages by this time.
      The CSS is the exact same for all 3 pages and the HTML for these areas
      must be the same on all 3 pages. <br>

    <span style="font-size: 14pt;">
      <strong> As we get to the end of the semester the grading will become
        stricter </strong> . This final project is a reflection of everything
      the course has taught and the feedback I have given. I will post a list of
      things I am looking for in your final project in the Developer Forum. This
      will be done after I have finished grading all Week 11 submissions on
      Sunday/Monday. Part of this final submission is a written essay. Make sure
      you follow the instructions carefully for the essay. I will be reading
      ever single one of them to make sure you write a coherent essay. </span>
