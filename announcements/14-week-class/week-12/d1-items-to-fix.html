    <title>A few things that must be fixed on your sites</title>

  <body>
    <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I have seen these issues on multiple
        submissions and they must be fixed before the submission of the
        final.</span></p>
    <ol>
      <li><span style="font-size: 14pt;">You must use the same CSS file for all
          your pages.</span></li>
      <li><span style="font-size: 14pt;">You must set a max-width. If you do not
          then a lot of your layouts will not look good for grading.</span></li>
      <li><span style="font-size: 14pt;">You must use the @media query like what
          was given in Week 7 of the Dry Oar website. This will allow you to
          display your site on a smartphone. There is another announcement
          specific to that.</span></li>
      <li><span style="font-size: 14pt;">You must optimize images. I am seeing a
          lot of images over 1 MB in size. These have a tendency to slow down
          the loading of pages and the ability to scroll up and
          down.</span><br /><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>W03
            Assignment: HTML for the Home Page - Step 8</strong> has the
          information about optimizing the images. There is a YouTube video as
          well about it. More info about this below.</span>
      </li>
      <li><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Do not use % for placement unless you
          know exactly what to expect. Most new developers do not understand how
          this works correctly. The % is based upon the parent elements size. So
          if your parent element is 1600px wide then it is a % of that width. If
          you screen is smaller than that such as 1368px wide (common 15 in
          monitor") then it is a % of 1386px.</span></li>
      <li><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Do not use position: absolute; This is
          creating issues with some layouts as I use a monitor much larger than
          what students use for grading. Very few website use position:
          absolute; it is useful in very few circumstances, such as creating a
          sticky header on your page or placing social media icons in a spot of
          your screen that never move as you scroll. Not good for placing text
          over an image.</span></li>
      <li><span style="font-size: 14pt;">You must use the fonts and colors you
          chose in your site plan.</span></li>
      <li><span style="font-size: 14pt;">The layouts must match what is in your
          wireframe in your site plan. I did post an image of my screen in the
          Week 11 Discussion Forum showing the 2 browsers open next to each
          other on 1 monitor.</span></li>
      <li><span style="font-size: 14pt;">You must validate all submissions
          before you submit. Quite a few of you have validation issues that are
          easy to fix if you just validate.</span></li>
    </ol>

    <h3><strong>Image Optimization helps</strong></h3>
    <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Here are a couple of articles with links
        to free image optimization tools</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><a
          href="https://www.wpwebify.com/blog/image-optimization-image-optimizer-tools/"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener">https://www.wpwebify.com/blog/image-optimization-image-optimizer-tools/</a></span>
    </p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><a

          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener">https://enviragallery.com/best-free-image-optimization-tools-for-image-compression/</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Most images just need to have the size and
        PPI (Pixels Per Inch) changed. Ideally the best PPI for web display is
        96 ppi. This is 95% of all monitors. Some very high-end displays like
        150 ppi.&nbsp; Think of it this way.</span></p>
    <ul>
      <li><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Newspapers print at 50 ppi</span></li>
      <li><span style="font-size: 14pt;">monitors default are 72 to 96ppi</span>
      </li>
      <li><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Photographs on photo paper is 300 to
          600 ppi</span></li>
      <li><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Magazines are 150 to 300 PPI</span>
      </li>
      <li><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Super glossy magazine print are
          800-1200 ppi. These images are very large in size on your hard drive
          and people will not wait for them to load on the screen.<br /></span>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Ideally you want your images to be no
        wider than 1600 px and if you have a max-size only make the banner
        images that wide.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Logo should have a physical size of no
        more than 200 px wide.</span></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Here is an example of what not to put on
        your site. This is a logo from a site plan which is fine for the site
        plan. This image is 1004 by 590 px with a PPI of 300 ppi. This original
        file size is 25 kb</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><img role="presentation"
          src="https://byui.instructure.com/courses/244898/files/107477806/preview"
          alt=""
          data-api-endpoint="https://byui.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/244898/files/107477806"
          data-api-returntype="File" /></span></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Here is a better version for use on the
        site. This is 550 px by 250 px still at 300 ppi. This file size is 18.1
        KB using the file type of webp. The file type does make a big
        difference.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"> <img role="presentation"
          src="https://byui.instructure.com/courses/244898/files/107477796/preview"
          alt=""
          data-api-endpoint="https://byui.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/244898/files/107477796"
          data-api-returntype="File" /></span></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">This is the same size but at 100ppi. You
        can see a slight difference but when you make this smaller to fin the
        logo area you will not be able to tell. This file size is 18.1
        kb.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><img role="presentation"
          src="https://byui.instructure.com/courses/244898/files/107477790/preview"
          alt=""
          data-api-endpoint="https://byui.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/244898/files/107477790"
          data-api-returntype="File" /></span></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">This is an SVG version of the logo. This
        is the best option for logos only, not photographs This image can be
        resized and it will not get distorted.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I do not know the name of the fonts used
        so I changed it a little to a font a I have. This file size is 11.6
        kb.</span>
    </p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><img role="presentation"
          src="https://byui.instructure.com/courses/244898/files/107477776/preview"
          alt=""
          data-api-endpoint="https://byui.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/244898/files/107477776"
          data-api-returntype="File" /></span></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">These are just some example so you can see
        that there are a lot of options to use for image optimizations&nbsp;
        Same principles apply to photograph images.&nbsp; PNG is the largest,
        JPG/JPEG is the second largest, WebP is a new format and is quite small.
      </span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">There is even a newer format but it is not
        widely supported yet, it is called HEIF &mdash; High Efficiency Image
        File Format. This will get adopted in the future as it was only
        released. This was created by Apple so only Apple devices support this
        format at this time.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">This is a good article that explains all
        the various formats and explains the pros and cons of each format.

    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>For this class only use the
          following:</strong></span></p>
    <ul>
      <li><span style="font-size: 14pt;">JPG/JPEG/JFIF/PHPEG/PIP - All these
          extensions are for the JPEG (Joint Photographic Expert Group image)
          format. Highly recommend changing the extension to .jpg for all these
          image types.</span></li>
      <li><span style="font-size: 14pt;">PNG - Portable Network
          Graphics.&nbsp;</span></li>
      <li><span style="font-size: 14pt;">WebP - Web Picture format - Created by
          Google</span></li>
      <li><span style="font-size: 14pt;">SVG - Scalable Vector Graphics</span>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">You will learn a lot more about graphics
        as you do more development and work with images.</span></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h3><strong>Free software to help with web content creation</strong></h3>
    <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I personally use <strong>GIMP</strong> (<a
          href="https://gimp.org" target="_blank"
          rel="noopener">https://gimp.org</a>) for image manipulation and I use
        <strong>Inkscape</strong> (<a href="https://inkscape.org"
          target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://inkscape.org</a>) for SVG
        images. Both are free as they are opensource software. If you go to
        install these on a Windows 10 or 11 machine you will get a security
        warning because you did not get the software from the Microsoft
        Store.&nbsp; The software is safe to use. </span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">There is another program that is a lot
        more complicated to use as it is for people that love to paint and draw,
        it is called <strong>Krita</strong> (<a href="https://krita.org"
          target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://krita.org</a>). I highly
        recommend this software if you have a drawing tablet connected to your
        computer and you like to paint and draw.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Here is a list of free software that can
        be used instead of a lot of very pricey software. I use all of these
        software programs.</span></p>
    <ul>
      <li><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Gimp (<a href="https://gimp.org"
            target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://gimp.org</a>) is similar to
          Adobe Photoshop</span></li>
      <li><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Inkscape (<a
            href="https://inkscape.org" target="_blank"
            rel="noopener">https://inkscape.org</a>) is similar to Adobe
          Illustrator</span></li>
      <li><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Krita (<a href="https://krita.org"
            target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://krita.org</a>) is a sketching
          and painting program designed for digital artists.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
      </li>
      <li><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Scribus (<a
            href="https://https://www.scribus.net/" target="_blank"
            rel="noopener">https://https://www.scribus.net/</a>) is similar to
          Adobe InDesign</span></li>
      <li><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Blender (<a href="https://blender.org"
            target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://blender.org</a>) is a 3D
          modeling software that you can created 3D animated movies.</span></li>
      <li><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Kdenlive (<a
            href="https://kdenlive.org" target="_blank"
            rel="noopener">https://kdenlive.org</a>)&nbsp; and OpenShot (<a
