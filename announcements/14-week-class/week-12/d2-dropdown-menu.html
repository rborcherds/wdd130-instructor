    <p>Quite a few student use the Dropdown menu component from W3Schools this week. I
        personally do not like the way that they have done that code. To me it is
        more complicated than it needs to be.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Here is an example dropdown menu that I created to show you a different way
        to do them. I never use the way that W3Schools does them in any website I
        create. Because I am doing a lot of coding in PHP and JavaScript, the
        list-item setup (ul/li tags) makes it a lot more complicated.</p>

    <p>I do use the arrow that a lot of you want to use. That icon is technically
        called a chevron. I got the SVG code from <a href="https://heroicons.com/"
            target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://heroicons.com/</a>. There are 2
        CSS rules that were created to change the color of the lines, set the width
        and height, change the thickness of the line and to line it up the way I
        wanted to the text.&nbsp; The class names are in the SVG code.</p>

    <p>Let me know if you have any questions about this in the Discussion Forum.</p>
