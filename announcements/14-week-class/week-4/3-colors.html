<body>
  <p>
    <span style="font-size: 18pt; color: #d70505;"> I am noticing that some of
      you are not using the colors from the site plan you created in week 2.
    </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong> Week 4 - Colors must be used from the Site Plan. Do not make the
      Body background-color and the background color for any other rule the
      same. The body must be a different color from the rest of the
      background-colors. This means that if you change your colors in your site,
      you must update the site plan with those colors. <br>
    </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong> Week 5 - The fonts used in week 5 must be from the site plan. Any
      rule with the h1 to h6 must be the heading font from the site plan. All
      other rules will use the paragraph font. </strong>
  </p>
  <p> The site plan is part of the grading when you submit the final in week 9
    for the rafting site. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>
    <span style="font-size: 14pt; color: #d70505;"> These rules will also apply
      to your personal site you will start to create in week 5. </span>
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Week 5</strong> you record a video of your personal site proposal.
      I will give you feedback as to what aspects you are allowed to do in this
      class. This is where you start to take what you have learned and apply
      that knowledge into something you create. We do not give you code for the
      site, we do supply a new site plan template as there is a lot more info in
      this second site plan.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p> Week 7 to 9 you will create the site plan for your personal site.We give
    you the template to use and it is different than the one in week 2. </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Week 7</strong> you have to select the colors and fonts, write the
      purpose and audience.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Week 8</strong> you have to create all the text and get at least 3
      images per page. There are 3 pages required for the site. One will contain
      a form where users enter info. You do not capture that info in this
      class.&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Week 9</strong> you create the wireframes for all 3 pages you will
      create.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Week 10</strong> you write the HTML code for all 3 pages on your
      own. No CSS yet. This is graded according to the content in the site plan
      you wrote and the images used from week 8.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Week 11 to 13</strong> you style each page and submit for grading
      according to your wireframes and site plan info, fonts, colors, etc.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Week 14</strong> you submit a final report and the URL to your
      final site. This is again graded against the site plan.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>
    <span style="font-size: 18pt;"> You will notice that Week 6 is not mentioned
      above. This is because you will be learning about grid layout which is a
      requirement in the rafting site and your personal site. Week 7 has you
      apply the grid layout and some flexbox layout to the homepage of the
      rafting site. </span>
