<body>
  <p> It has come to my attention as I am looking at your CSS files to see if
    you are making all the correct changes, I am seeing a few things that need
    to be clarified. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>
    <span style="font-size: 14pt; color: #34495e;">
      <strong> Fonts:&nbsp; If you are using Google Fonts, the @import line must
        be the first line in your CSS file or the fonts do not work. </strong>
    </span>
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>When you see a code block like this with the dots between the tags</p>
  <pre>&lt;body&gt;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;div id="content"&gt;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;header&gt;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; . . .<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;/footer&gt;<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;/div&gt;<br />&lt;/body&gt;</pre>
  <p>This means that you have to look for the code segment above and below the
    dots and you insert the new code into your code so that they look the same.
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>When the instructions have rules written like this:</p>
  <p>
    <span style="color: #b58900;">
      <kbd>.book, .join</kbd> &nbsp; </span>
  </p>
  <p>That means you write that as 1 rule like this in your CSS file.</p>
  <pre>.book, .join {<br>  &nbsp; color: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;#fff;<br>  &nbsp; background-color: #0443b3;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; padding: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;15px 30px;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; margin: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 50px 0 0 0;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; border-radius: &nbsp; &nbsp;5px;<br>}</pre>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>
    <span style="color: #b58900;">
      <kbd>.rivers-card, .camping-card, .rapids-card</kbd>
    </span>
    <span>&nbsp; margin: 200px 0;</span>
  </p>
  <p><span>The rule will look like this</span></p>
  <pre><span>.rivers-card, .camping-card, .rapids-card {<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; margin: &nbsp; &nbsp; 200px 0;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; text-align: center;<br>}</span></pre>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>
    <span style="font-size: 14pt;">
      <strong>
        <span style="color: #0810a1;"> Do not add any rules that are not
          specified in the instructions until after week 7 </span>
      </strong> . <span style="font-size: 12pt;"> Week 7 you will be doing the
        page layout using display: flex and display: grid. If you have any
        display: block, display: inline, etc you must remove them as they will
        mess up the layout in week 7 </span>
    </span>
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h3>
    <span style="color: #0810a1;"> Some of you are putting styling in the HTML
      file. </span>
  </h3>
  <p>in the HTML tag you do something like this.</p>
  <pre>&lt;img src="images/image.jpg" <span style="color: #ff0000;">style="width: 300px;"</span>&gt;</pre>
  <p> That is not allowed in this class and not allowed in almost all web
    development classes at BYU-Idaho. The school is teaching HTML5 which means
    that all styling must be separated from the HTML. The HTML file loads the
    styling from CSS files. There is no exception in this class to this rule.
    You will not get full points on the assignments when I see that and I do let
    you remove the and resubmit. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>
    <span style="color: #0810a1;">
      <strong>
        <span style="font-size: 14pt;"> You must read all the instructions to
          make sure you do not miss something </span> . </strong>
    </span> A few of you that I have had zoom calls with have realized how
    important it is to read all the instructions. They have realized that they
    did miss a lot of little details that make a big difference in the web page.
    Common things that students miss in week 4 are missing rules, spelling
    issues, difference between id/class names in the HTML vs the CSS files.
    Using the incorrect selector (tag name, class name selector, id name
    selector).
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>
    <span style="font-size: 14pt; color: #0810a1;"> The image below shows where
      some of the various HTML sections will be in the final layout. </span>
    Your layout will match this, your colors and font will be your own. The
    header area is my own and not what you will have.&nbsp; I have this image
    set to 1200px wide. The original image is 2645px wide. If you cannot see
    this image please try a different browser. I use the webp image format which
    is half the size of jpg images and it is still over 1mb in size.
  </p>
  <p> This image is to help you decide where the colors you have chosen in your
    <strong>SITE PLAN</strong> and the the fonts you are using will be displayed
    on your page. Some of you will need to change the background or the text
    color so that you can see them on the page. </p>
