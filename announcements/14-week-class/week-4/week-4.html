  <h2>
    <span style="color: #081470;"> HTML &amp; CSS styling for your Home Page
    </span>
  </h2>
  <p>
    <span style="font-size: 14pt;"> This week you will start styling you Home
      Page with CSS. It is very important that you have finished the Home Page
      assignment before starting this one. Every web page you visit on the
      internet uses CSS to style the way the page looks and acts most of the
      time. Sometimes it requires JavaScript with CSS to make a page act a
      certain way. </span>
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <span style="font-size: 14pt;"> The first thing you do is watch 3 video
        and take a quiz on those videos. </span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <span style="font-size: 14pt;"> You then do an activity on <strong>Units
          of Measurement Practice</strong> . This is a very important activity
        in that you learn various ways that items are measured in a web page.
        Thee are relative and absolute measurements in web development. </span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <span style="font-size: 14pt;"> You then have an activity where you learn
        about <strong>Block vs Inline elements</strong> . Block is the default
        layout. Inline was added shortly after block to the way a page layout
        can be done. You have to now how these work because if you do not
        specify a display type, you will default to block. </span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <span style="font-size: 14pt;"> You then have a <strong>CSS Selectors
          Practice</strong> activity. For this class you will use global, tag
        name, class and sometime ID. You will also use pseudo selectors. There
        are more types but you will not really get into those during this class.
      </span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <span style="font-size: 14pt;"> You will have a <strong>Challenge</strong>
        activity. You can work in groups if you wish on this activity. There are
        2 images in the challenge but it is only one page. The title of the page
        has a hover effect when you move the mouse over the title of the page.
      </span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <span style="font-size: 14pt;"> You have an activity about <strong>Backend
          Development</strong> . You watch a video about what they do and some
        of the technologies they use and the type of career options are out
        there for these types of developers. </span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <span style="font-size: 14pt;"> You then do your assignment to submit:
        <strong>Adding More HTML and CSS</strong> Remember to look at the rubric
        and to follow the instructions carefully. This is when a lot of students
        start to miss points because they did not follow the instructions
        carefully. </span>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>
    <span style="font-size: 14pt;"> Ask questions in the Developer Forum about
      the CSS structure if you are tying to do something that you are having a
      hard time figuring out. Please post a copy of what you have and explain
      what you want to do. </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span style="font-size: 14pt;"> You will be seeing and learning a lot of new
      terms, please ask questions if you have any questions. Here is another CSS
      resource similar to W3Schools. <a

      class. </span>

  <h3>
    <strong>
      <span style="color: #081470;"> Important info about adding styling to your
        site </span> . </strong>
  </h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <span style="font-size: 14pt;"> It is vital that you <strong>DO NOT
          USE</strong> the site-plan.css file for any other work. </span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <span style="font-size: 14pt;"> All styling for the website must be in a
        style.css file. <br>
      </span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <span style="font-size: 14pt;">
        <strong>DO NOT USE</strong> styling within the HTML file. All styling
        must be done in the CSS file. </span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <span style="font-size: 14pt;"> Remember that the colors and fonts you
        chose in the site plan are the colors and fonts you are to use for this
        site. If you change colors, fonts or sub pages you must update the site
        plan files. Final grade compares your site to the site plan to see how
        well you followed the site plan. </span>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>
    <span style="color: #081470;"> Spiritual Thought/Question for the Week
    </span>
  </h2>
  <p>
    <span style="font-size: 14pt;"> In the scriptures we read that we are to
      have a Broken Heart and a Contrite Spirit ( 2 Nephi 2:7, 3 Nephi 9:20,
      Moroni 6:2 ). </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span style="font-size: 14pt;"> The meanings of these two terms is very
      important for us, especially as it relates to school. </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span style="font-size: 14pt;">
      <strong>Broken Heart</strong> : Being humble and under proper control of
      ourselves. </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span style="font-size: 14pt;">
      <strong>Contrite Spirit</strong> : Contrite means desiring correction as
      needed </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span style="font-size: 14pt;"> For us to learn effectively, we need to be
      humble and not proud so that we are teachable and we need to have the
      desire to be corrected when we do something incorrect. This is how we
      learn and grow the most effectively. </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span style="font-size: 14pt;"> What other scriptures or General Conference
      talks teach this principle? </span>
  </p>
