  <h2>The things that I see that need to be fixed.</h2>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> 1.&nbsp; <strong>Everything must be in 1 GitHub Repository</strong>
    (repo). A few of you have create a few repo's for the various parts of the
    site. Everything must be in one repository. The homepage for the repo was
    created in the Week 2 GitHub setup instructions step 4 &amp; 6. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> 2.&nbsp; <strong>Some of you are missing some of the details.</strong> I
    have mentioned the importance of details in a previous announcement. The
    details some of you are missing is 2 fold. The first is you are not reading
    all the instructions carefully. For example close to half of the students
    missed the last sentence of step 7 about the year in the copyright notice.
    The other big detail that has been missed is the spelling of the folders and
    file names to the images. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> 3.&nbsp; <strong>Absolute vs relative URLs for the images</strong> . When
    you start a src= with a /, you are telling the browser to look for the file
    starting at the homepage level of the site. If you do not start with the /,
    then you are telling the browser to find the file based upon the current
    folder the of the file location. </p>
  <p> This is an absolute location:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;img class="logo" src="
    <strong>/wwr/images/logo.png</strong> " alt="Dry Oar Logo"&gt;. This cannot
    find the file on GitHub but can on the local Live Server. To find this file
    on GitHub the correct code is something like this: &lt;img class="logo"
    src="/wdd130/wwr/images/logo.png" alt="Dry Oar Logo"&gt;. This will not work
    on your local live server for testing. This is why a relative URL is best
    like this one: &lt;img class="logo" src="images/logo.png" alt="Dry Oar
    Logo"&gt;. As long as the images folder is in the same folder as the
    index.html, the server can fint the file, no matter if it is on the local
    machine or on the server. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> 4.&nbsp; <strong>Images</strong> . Quite a few of you have used images on
    the internet. If you are using one of the free image sites, you must
    download the image and put it into your images folder. The reason for this
    is that the image you are linking to has a watermark in it to show that it
    is copyrighted and thus illegal to use this way. You have to create an
    account on that site, download a copy of the file and put it onto your own
    server. </p>
  <p> Do not use your own images if they are not about river running. The images
    must make sense for what the content is about. You will get more instruction
    on this in Week 8 when you have to gather the images and write the content
    for your personal site. Images will most likely have to be in your repo for
    your personal site, so I recommend practicing now with them. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> 5.&nbsp; <strong>Background colors:</strong> &nbsp; Quite a few of you are
    using white for the body background and the a few other places. Take a loo
    at the discussion forum as I have an image that has been marked with the
    main HTML tags as to where they will end up in week 7 when you do the
    layout. This week you will add a couple more HTML tags and this image shows
    those tags and where they go. </p>
  <p> Putting a background color on paragraphs and headers is OK as long as
    there is a reason for it. In this design, there is no reason. Most of the
    time all the text in a section or div will have the same background color.
    The issue with doing the background color on just a paragraph or heading tag
    is that unless you add padding, the background color is just as tall as the
    text. Background colors tend to be much larger and you have multiple tags
    withing the background color. The exception is buttons. Make sure you do not
    use white for button background colors unless you have a reason. Buttons
    must stand out and call attention to them. I will have examples of buttons
    in week 10. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> 6.&nbsp; <strong>Footer background color</strong> :&nbsp; The standard on
    the internet is to make the &lt;footer&gt; background denote the end of the
    page. Make it a color that is not defined in your Site Plan. #3e3e3e is a
    very popular shade for footer. I will give examples of footer in week 9/10
    in the discussion forum as that becomes a topic you have to address in your
    personal site. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> 7.&nbsp; <strong>Inline Styling</strong> . This is the CSS code put into
    the HTML tags directly. <span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>DO NOT DO
        IT</strong></span> . This goes against the HTML5 standards of separating
    the markup with the styling. All styling must go into the CSS file. No image
    width or height allowed in the HTML. </p>
  <p>Here is a common example with the bolded items that is not allowed:</p>
  <p> &lt;img src="https://borcherds-ralph.github.io/wdd130.." alt="image
    description" <strong>width="600px"&nbsp; style="widht: 600px;"</strong> &gt;
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> 8.&nbsp; Personal Logos.&nbsp; When using a different logo than the ones
    presented in the class, make sure you get rid of all the extra space around
    the logo.Here is an example. This is a logo one of the students in the
    semester is using. This is the original logo. </p>
  <p>
    <img
      src="https://borcherds-ralph.github.io/wdd130/announcements/images/logo-example-0.png"
      alt="logo example">
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>This is that same logo set to the width we will use in the class.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>
    <img
      src="https://borcherds-ralph.github.io/wdd130/announcements/images/logo-example-0.png"
      alt="logo example" width="80">
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> Now here is the same image with a background with all the white-space that
    I have colored for this example set to 80px wide which is what you will be
    using in this course. </p>
  <p>
    <img
      src="https://borcherds-ralph.github.io/wdd130/announcements/images/logo-example-1.png"
      alt="logo -2" width="80">
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Here is the logo again with the extra space removed</p>
  <p>
    <img
      src="https://borcherds-ralph.github.io/wdd130/announcements/images/logo-example-2.png"
      alt="logo-3" width="80">
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> As you can see with the colored backgrounds, the one with all the extra
    space removed is a larger logo overall and easier to read,&nbsp; Personally
    I would make this logo into an SVG file for use. If you know how to do that
    go ahead and do it.&nbsp; Here is one of the Dry Oar logos I did as an SVG
    image.&nbsp;I put a dark background and padding so you could see the image.
    Without the padding there is not extra space around the logo. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>This is full size.</p>
  <p>
    <img style="background-color: #3f3f3f; padding: 1em;"
      src="https://borcherds-ralph.github.io/wdd130/announcements/images/dry-oar-2.svg"
      alt="SVG Logo">
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>This is at 80px. You will notice the readability is still there.</p>
  <p>
    <img style="background-color: #3f3f3f; padding: 1em;"
      src="https://borcherds-ralph.github.io/wdd130/announcements/images/dry-oar-2.svg"
      alt="SVG Logo" width="80">
  </p>
  <p> I used a free program called Inkscape (inkscape.org) to create the image.
    It is very similar to Adobe Illustrator. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> Let me know if you do not understand something or need more clarification
