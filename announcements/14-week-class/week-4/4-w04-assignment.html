<body>
  <p> Some of you have already submitted this assignment and I am noticing a
    trend. </p>
  <p>The &lt;div id="background"&gt;&lt;/div&gt; background color must:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>be a different color from the body</li>
    <li> cannot be the same color as the &lt;section class="msg"&gt; background
      color </li>
  </ul>
  <p>You must change the text color for the items in step 13.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>nav a</li>
    <li>nav a:hover</li>
    <li>.home-title</li>
    <li>h4</li>
    <li>.book, .join</li>
    <li>.book:hover, .join:hover</li>
    <li>.msg h2</li>
    <li>msg p</li>
    <li>footer</li>
    <li>footer a</li>
    <li>footer a:hover</li>
  </ul>
  <p> The reason is that this is what the basic page will look like when done.
    The header in this image is my own design, yours will be different. I did
    make mine look like an oar on purpose. I did not change the color of the
    links in the footer. I personally do not like that in the footer. I did a
    few things that are not part of the instructions so that if someone copies
    my code I will know. I also used grid layout a little bit more than what the
    instructions will tell you to do. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> The background colors mentioned above are for the image with the text over
    it and to the right at the bottom. You can also see why the text color must
    be changed as this image shows all the text colors that the instructions
    tell you to change. </p>

  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> The footer is a standard background color used on a lot of sites. The
    instructions do not specifically tell you to change the footer background
    but I highly recommend it. </p>
  <p> If you have a dark color scheme then make the footer a lighter color. If
    you color scheme is lighter then do a dark footer. You want the footer to
    denote the end of the page by being in complete contrast with the rest of
    the page. Mu color is #3e3e3e for the footer background color. </p>
