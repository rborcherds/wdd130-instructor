  <h2>Background Colors you set in Week 4</h2>
  <p> To help you know where the final colors will go, here is a screenshot of
    the final layout with the main HTML tags for that part of the page. You will
    do the layout in week 7 but knowing where the colors go will help. </p>

  <p> In this image the blue background is on the body rule. Most of you will
    not see this on your screen due to your screens not being wide enough by
    default. Look at my previous post about a trick to see the full width and
    the border. </p>
