  <h1 class="western">Welcome to Week 13</h1>
  <h3 class="western"> This week you have two things to do. Finish your Personal
    Site and do the end of course survey </h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <span style="font-size: large;"> You will submit your last page for
        grading this week. <br>
      </span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <span style="font-size: large;"> You will take the end of course survey.
        This is used by the school to determine if the coursework should be
        changed in any way or improved upon. </span>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>
    <span style="font-size: 14pt; color: #0810a1;"> If you are going to do the
      Extra Credit, it is due by the end of this week. You can ask questions in
      the Discussion Forum about it. </span>
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>
    <strong>
      <span style="font-size: large;"> If you have any issues or questions
        please contact me. </span>
    </strong>
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>
    <span style="font-size: 14pt;"> There is no more spiritual discussions as
      most of you are thinking more about the end of classes. I would recommend
      you write about the inspiration you get in your personal journal from this
      class. Remember that Jesus Christ chastised Nephi in 3 Nephi 23:9-12 for
      not recording the words of Samuel the Lamanite.&nbsp; Your journal can be
      used by others as a teaching tool. <br>
