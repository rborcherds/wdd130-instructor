        <p>I watched this live and I thought I would share it with my students.
            The video is 43 min long and it shows you 5 CSS techniques you
            should find useful and fun to do.</p>
            <p>These technique uses the
            :before and :after pseudo elements in CSS. This is similar to the
            :hover pseudo element.</p>
