    <h2>Positioning Activity</h2>
    <p> I want you to all start thinking of web pages as dynamic in width. This
      assignment can help with that. Here are some tips. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p> For some reason a lot of students do not use the hints in this activity.
    </p>
    <p> Every single activity in this assignment has a hint on how to accomplish
      this. </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Click the bar with the word HINT in it.</li>
      <li> Only activity 1 has instructions that are given to you to do this
        first one. Everyone should get this correct if you follow the steps
        exactly. </li>
      <li>Each one has a link to an image as to how it is supposed to look.</li>
      <li> Activity #6 hint has an additional graphic in the hint with the grid
        lines to help you with the layout. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Activity #2</strong> can be done with either grid or margins. Do
      not use both as I will have you redo it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Activities 3, 4, &amp; 6</strong> should have the width and the
      height set to 100%.&nbsp;&nbsp; Set the height&nbsp; in the .content rule
      for each and use 1fr measurements for the width.&nbsp; That make them
      dynamic width. Only #6 has a set width and height set in the parent rule
      only.
    </p>
    <p> If you do not you can end up with something like this on my
      monitor.&nbsp; I use a 3525px wide monitor for grading. It shows when
      something is not dynamic very quickly. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
      <strong>The only activity that cannot be done with grid is #5</strong> .
    </p>
    <p> If not setup correctly this is what it will look like n a small screen.
      You must keep the text in the yellow at all times no matter what the
      screen width is. I do use a small width and large width setup to check
      this. </p>

    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p> This is what Activity 5 should look like on a large monitor before I
      shrink the size to test it. This one property on the yellow color that
      makes this possible. Setting a starting height on the yellow just larger
      than the green square. </p>

    <p>This is what it should look like on a small monitor</p>
