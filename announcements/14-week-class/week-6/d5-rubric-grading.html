        <h2>How to check Rubric Grading</h2>
        <p>Starting in Week 6, the Rubric grading will be used a lot for
            feedback.</p>
        <p>The first thing to do is to go to your grades</p>
        <p>
            <img src="https://borcherds-ralph.github.io/wdd130/announcements/images/rubric-grade-link.png"
                alt="Grade Link">
        </p>
        <p>Then find the assignment and click the Rubric icon</p>
        <p><img src="https://borcherds-ralph.github.io/wdd130/announcements/images/rubric-link.png"
                alt="Rubric Link Icon"></p>
        <p>This will expand the rubric. This image shows all 3 things you need
            to look at.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The first thing to look at is to make sure that there is a grade
                on every line. If not let the instructor know. Every once in a
                while a option does not get recorded correctly.</li>
            <li>The next thing to look for is the graded items that do not have
                a full score. Look at the wording in the full score option and
                see what what graded</li>
            <li>The look at the comment for those items you do not have a full
                score. Those are the items you need to work on.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><img src="https://borcherds-ralph.github.io/wdd130/announcements/images/rubric.png"
                alt="Rubric"></p>
        <p>There may be other comments under the comments icon. that is the icon
            with the talk bubbles and there is usually a number in that icon.
            Read those comments as well.</p>
        <h3>Personal Site Grading</h3>
        <p>Starting in week 7, the grading for the personal site shows a
            checkmark or an X if the assignment is not done. The issue is that
            even tough you have a checkmark, you may not have received full
            points. This is the way the system works.</p>
        <p>Grades are calculated on the points earned for these assignments, not
            if they were done or not. The only way to know if you missed any
            points is to look at the rubric.</p>
        <h3>How grades are calculated</h3>
        <p>This is how grades are calculated in a weighted grading class.</p>
        <p>Take all the points earned in each section and calculate the
            percentage</p>
        <p>For WDD130 this is the point breakdown:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Preperation quizzes - 70 points - 10%</li>
            <li>Rafting Website Assignments - 150 points - 34%</li>
            <li>Ponder Assignments - 120 points - 13%</li>
            <li>Personal Website Assignments - 250 points - 43%</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Lets say you have the following points to total</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Preperation quizzes - 65 / 70 points</li>
            <li>Rafting Website Assignments - 140 / 150 points</li>
            <li>Ponder Assignments - 120/120 points</li>
            <li>Personal Website Assignments - 200 / 250 points</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You calculate it like this</p>
        <ul>
            <li>65 / 70 = .92857 * .1 = .092857 * 100 = 9.2857</li>
            <li>140/150 = .93333 * .34 = .317333 * 100 = 31.733</li>
            <li>120 / 120 = 1 * .13 = .13 * 100 = 13</li>
            <li>200 / 250 = 0.8 * .43 = .344 * 100 = 34.4 </li>
        </ul>
        <p>You then add the totals for each category</p>
        <p>9.2857 + 31.733 + 13 + 34.4 = 88.4187%</p>
        <p>Your grade will be 88.42% or a B+</p>
