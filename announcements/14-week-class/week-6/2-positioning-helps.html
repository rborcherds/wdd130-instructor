    <h3> I have already graded a few submissions but there is a theme that must
      be addressed now. </h3>
    <p> Make sure to read the hints for each activity as there is some notes
      that the creators wrote. There is a Discussion Forum post that gives more
      hints as well. </p>
    <ul>
      <li> All items except #2 &amp; #6&nbsp; must go full width inside the
        borders already set. </li>
      <li> #2 width and height of the colored boxes cannot be changed. You use
        what you have been give to do the layout shown in the example image
      </li>
      <li> #5 must be able to keep the text in the yellow at all time no matter
        with width of the screen. Chances are that your screen size is different
        from mine and that does affect the layout. </li>
      <li> #6 you do need to look at the image in the hint as it shows you the
        grid lines. You must also change the width and height of each color to
        100% and set the grid size correctly in the content6 rule. This is a 6x6
        grid of equal width and height for each row and column. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h3>How I grade this assignment</h3>
    <p> The CSS is given to you to start with. I copy your CSS from the top to
      this point.This is usually around line 210 in your CSS file. </p>
    <pre>/* Do not make any changes below here */<br>.activity {</pre>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p> Any changes after these two lines with is line 160/161 in the CSS give
      to you is not allowed. I have had a lot of students in the past that have
      set a fixed width to do the layouts past this line thinking that I would
      not notice. This is why I grade in this manner. </p>
    <p> Here is a screenshot of the finished activity showing a wide screen of
      1890px.&nbsp; 857px screenshot below this one. I show you these as you
      need to start to think in this manner when creating a web page. You will
      have to think like this when designing/coding your personal site. This is
      all done with CSS. </p>

    <p> 857px wide screenshot. You will notice that #2 &amp; 6 did not change in
      width but all the others did and still kept the correct look. You will
      also notice that in #5, the text stays inside the yellow color and the
      yellow grew in height. </p>
