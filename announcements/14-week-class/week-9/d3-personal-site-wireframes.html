        <p>Things not to put into your personal site wireframes and thus not in
            the HTML </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Search Bars -&gt; GitHub.io does not allow you to do support this. To
            put a search site option on your site, you have to build the search
            engine into the site. This means a 3rd party piece of software
            configured to search what you tell it to searhc.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Blog pages -&gt; Do not even put the title of BLOG or anything
            similar. I will kick those back and have you redo them.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>a 4th Page -&gt; Do not add additional pages unless you want it to
            count towards/against your grade on the final. I will only be
            grading 3 pages before your submit your final so that 4th page will
            not be graded and thus you could have lots of things wrong with it
            that will count against the grade. It will not help the grade
            either.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>A form to collect information such as selling, newsletter, community,
            etc sign-ups. These require an SQL back-end and also being able to
            send e-mails. This is not supported in github.io and is outside the
            scope of this class. </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Your real e-mail, phone, contact info unless you take some
            precautions. Most sites have a form for people to fill out to
            contact the company but that is not supported on github.io. I do
            have a post in week 10 that talks specifically about some techniques
            to help keep your info safe but they are not guaranteed.</p>
