  <h2><span style="color: #081470;">What to expect.</span></h2>
  <p>
    <span style="color: #081470;"> The first activity you will do is an ICE
      Challenge. </span>
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h4>
    <span style="color: #ff0000;">
      <strong>There are 2 big deadlines this week.</strong>
    </span>
  </h4>
  <p> The first is the completion of the Dry Oar website (the one we have been
    working on from the beginning of the semester.) </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>
    <strong>
      <span style="font-size: large;"> The second big deadline is the finished
        site plan. </span>
    </strong> This is all the text for all 3 pages including images and the
    wireframes for your personal site. The instructions state
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        <em>Significant textual content</em> consisting of appropriate content
        for your audience so that they can understand the meaning and message of
        this site
      </p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p> This means at least 300 words for each page. You will not use that many on
    the page but the more content you have the easier it will be to create the
    text for the web page. </p>
  <p> There are 2 parts to the Site Plan document activity. Make sure you go
    through both parts as they will help you gather your thoughts and give you
    ideas on where to get the images, etc. Always remember to use the Principles
    of Good Design ( <a

    ) </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> You will create 3 wireframes for the pages you will create. You are not
    doing any HTML coding for your personal site yet. You do not need to put
    real text in the wireframe. Just put blocks denoting text areas or use Lorem
    Ipsum text. </p>

    <strong>
      <span style="color: #081470;"> Quite a few of you have had issues
        exporting the wireframes as images. </span>
    </strong>

  <p> There are some extensions you can add to your browser that will allow you
    to take screenshots or you can use the Snipping Tool built into Windows or
    MacOS. </p>
