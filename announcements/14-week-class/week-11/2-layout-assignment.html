  <h2>In the Layout Revisited assignment</h2>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h3>
    <span style="color: #34495e;">
      <span style="color: #050b77;">
        <strong>For the CSS Grid Garden exercise</strong>
      </span>
    </span>
  </h3>
  <p> You must submit the image after you have click next on level 28. I need
    the display after that level. You will not get full credit for any other
    screenshot. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h3>
    <strong><span style="color: #050b77;">The poem alignment</span></strong>
  </h3>
  <p>You must use the codepen.io website to do this assignment.</p>
  <p> If you cannot see the full page layout, you must change the display.&nbsp;
    The easiest way is to move the bar that separates the code and the display
    up. You just drag it up. </p>
  <p> The other way is to make sure you have copied all the CSS and then change
    the display to Details View </p>
  <p>

      alt="codepen switcher">
  </p>
  <p> Then select the Details View from that list. This process sometimes does
    reset the code. This is why you must have a copy of the CSS before you do
    this. </p>
  <p>The output will be on the right side of the screen versus the bottom.</p>
