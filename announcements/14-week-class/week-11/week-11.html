  <h2>
    <strong><span style="color: #0810a1;">Week 11</span></strong>
  </h2>
  <p>
    <span style="font-size: 14pt;"> This week you will complete all 28 levels of
      game to learn grid called CSS Grid Garden. This does take some time to do
      so plan accordingly. You will also have an activity using CodePen.io. Both
      of these activities require you to submit the final screens of the
      activities for grading. I have an announcement that will be posted on
      Monday on how to get the best screenshot from Codepen for submission. <br>
    </span>
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>
    <span style="font-size: 14pt;"> You will spend more time on layouts this
      week as you work on styling your homepage. Your homepage styled is what is
      due this week but you can work on your entire site. Remember that you will
      want to reuse as many of the CSS class names on all your pages as possible
      so think about how you will do that. <strong> Make sure you change the
        &lt;title&gt; tag that in &lt;head&gt; of each HTML file with the
        correct title name for each page. A lot of you have the same title for
        all pages. They must be different. </strong>
      <br>
    </span>
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>
    <span style="font-size: 14pt;"> As always make sure you validate the HTML
      and CSS before you submit. I will try and get all these graded within 12
      hours of you submitting them so that you can keep working on the rest of
      the site. You will want to do as much as you can as quickly as you can so
      you can fine tune the layout before the final submission. </span>
  </p>

      <strong>Week 11 Developer Discussion Board</strong>
    </span>
  </h2>
  <p>
    <span style="font-size: 14pt;"> I have posted some more tips in the Week 11
      Discussion Board on things to look for and shortcuts on the tags. As
      always this is a great place to ask questions. Please do so earlier in the
      week than latter. These posts on tips come from things I am seeing some
      students do in this class and to help you streamline you coding efforts.

  <h3>
    <span style="color: #0810a1;">
      <strong>Extra Credit Assignment starts this week</strong>
    </span>
  </h3>
  <p>
    <span style="font-size: 14pt;"> I have created an extra credit assignment
      that you can do to either learn how to be better at grid layouts and/or
      raise your grade. This will be applied to your final submission score for
      your personal site after all the grading is completed. </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span style="font-size: 14pt;"> This extra credit is one where you have to
      create all the CSS to match the image in the assignment. There are 7 grids
      in total and 2 forms that are to be formatted using grid only. This is to
      help you better do your layout on your personal site. Each grid has a
      different color and you can use what ever colors you want to use for each
      grid. Do not overthink this. Take it one grid at a time. </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span style="font-size: 14pt;"> You have until the end of Week 13 to finish
      this and no late submissions will be allowed as I will be posting the CSS
      that I used to create this at the beginning of week 14. </span>
  </p>
