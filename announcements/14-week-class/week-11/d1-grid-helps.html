  <h2>Grid Layout</h2>
  <p> A lot of you are having issues with Grid layout. Most are missing basic
    concepts about grids. </p>
  <p>A few rules to remember</p>
  <ul>
    <li> column/row numbers refer to the starting line of the column/row. A
      grid-column: 2/5; means that you start at column 2 starting line and end
      at the starting line for column 5. </li>
    <li> Even if you define the rows and columns, you can always add
      rows/columns outside of the defined grid. This does change the layout.
    </li>
    <li> Using grid-column-start, grid-column-end values is easier than
      grid-area.&nbsp; </li>
  </ul>
  <pre>These two properties<br>grid-column-start: 2;<br>grid-column-end: 5;<br><br>are the same as this<br>grid-column: 2/5;<br><br>and the same as this grid-area<br>grid-area: 2 / 5 / 1 / 1;<br><br><br>These 4 properties<br>grid-column-start: 2;<br>grid-column-end: 5;<br>grid-row-start; 1;<br>grid-row-end; 6;<br><br>are the same as this<br>grid-column: 2/5;<br>grid-row 1/6;<br><br>and the same as this grid-area<br>grid-area: 2 / 5 / 1 / 6;</pre>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> There are a lot of ways to define columns and rows. These are just the
    basics. </p>
  <p>Now for some help with the extra credit assignment</p>
  <p> Take a look at this example: <a

  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> &nbsp;For a details about all aspects of CSS Grid take a look at this
    site: <a href="https://gridbyexample.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
      https://gridbyexample.com/ </a> &nbsp; &nbsp; The example I recreated came
    from this site. </p>
  <p> There will be more information than you can understand and utilize at this
    time on this site. Keep it as a reference. Make sure you understand what you
    are going to use before you use it. One of the hardest parts of any
    development is going back to make a change that you do not remember what you
    did. </p>
