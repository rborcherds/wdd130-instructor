<body>
  <p> Are there any questions or issues with setting up the folder/directory
    structure for this and other classes? </p>
  <p> Any questions or issues with installing VSCode on your computer? I can
    help with Windows, MAC, and Linux. I run Linux as my daily everyday machine
    and I have virtual machines for the other 2 OS's. </p>
  <p> There is an extension I recommend that is not in the instructions. It is
    called Project Manager. With this extension you can switch between your
    various coding classes without having to find the folder every time you
    switch between them. </p>
