  <p> It has come to my attention that a lot of you do not know that you do have
    an e-mail with @byui.edu. <strong> As someone that has attended classes
      through this university, you have this e-mail address for life. </strong>
  </p>
  <h3>
    <span style="color: #050b77;">
      <strong> Pathway Worldwide Students <br>
      </strong>
    </span>
  </h3>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> From the Pathway dashboard, change the drop down in the center to say
    BYU-Idaho </p>
  <p>

  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Then click on your name in the top right corner.</p>
  <p> There is a link to "Go to Email". Arrow in this image is pointing to the
    link </p>

  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> You will be given the normal BYU-Idaho or BYU Pathway Worldwide login
    page. Click the Pathway Worldwide button and login as normal. </p>
  <p> This will take you to the Outlook online interface. If you have never
    accessed this e-mail account, you will have well 100 e-mails in there. This
    is especially true if you did not modify the notifications that Canvas sends
    on-demand by default. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> It is very important that you check this e-mail address. Canvas sends notifications to this e-mail
    by default and almost every instructor sends e-mails using this e-mail
    address before the semester starts.</p>
  <p> Once you know your BYU-Idaho e-mail address, you can login to your e-mail
    directly by going to: <a href="https://login.microsoftonline.com">
      https://login.microsoftonline.com </a> . You enter your BYU-Idaho e-mail
    address and then you will be prompted to login using the normal BYU-Idaho
    login page. </p>
  <p>Pathway students find that from the instructions above. Other students find
    it on the <a href="http://my.byui.edu" target="_blank">my.byui.edu</a> page
    under the Profile tab after you login.</p>
  <h2>BYU-Idaho e-mail addresses</h2>
  <p>You will have this e-mail address for the rest of your life.</p>
