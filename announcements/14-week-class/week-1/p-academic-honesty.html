  <h2>Academic Honesty as it relates to the BYU-Idaho Honor Code</h2>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Some of you may have experience with HTML/CSS
      and other web technologies in the past. One of the things you have to be pay
      attention to is the Academic Honesty at BYU-Idaho. Because we have students
      from a lot of countries, I want to make sure you all understand what
      BYU-Idaho expects. Each culture has a slightly different interpretation of
      these Honesty Policies and in the work place it is different as well, but we
      are in a school setting.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">This is taken directly from training the
      instructors receive about the various ways students can violate the Honor
      Code in your courses. In this class and many of the development classes the
      most common forms are Fabrication, Cheating, and Other Misconduct from the
      definitions below.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>The way you cheat is by using code you
        did not write,</strong> using libraries, such as jQuery, and using
      templates or frameworks such as Bootstrap without authorization from the
      instructor to complete the work. Some libraries are required to complete
      work in other classes. The real world this is not an issue to use public
      libraries as that is what they are for. For school work, they want to make
      sure you know how everything works by having you create it from scratch.
      This does help you once you get into the real world to troubleshoot
      bugs.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">All instructors look for these things in the
      work that is submitted. Personally, I have used a lot of libraries and tools
      for work and I have spent thousands of dollars to buy licenses as well. I
      have seen a lot of libraries and I know what they look like.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Dishonesty may get you good grades but at what
      cost?</span></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2>Academic Dishonesty Definitions</h2>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h3><strong>Inadvertent Plagiarism</strong></h3>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Inadvertent plagiarism involves the
      inappropriate, but non-deliberate, use of another's words, ideas, or data
      without proper attribution. Although not a violation of the Honor Code, it
      is a form of academic misconduct for which an instructor can impose
      appropriate academic sanctions.</span></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h3><strong>Plagiarism</strong></h3>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Intentional plagiarism is the deliberate act
      of representing the words, ideas, or data of another as one's own without
      providing proper attribution on the original author through quotation,
      reference, or footnote.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Plagiarism is probably the most well-known
      element of academic dishonesty. T</span><span
      style="font-size: 14pt; color: var(--ic-brand-font-color-dark);">his
      includes the use of artificial intelligence technologies such as
      ChatGPT&nbsp; or using HTML, CSS, or JavaScript you did not personally write
      or are not given permission to use and passing it off as your own.</span>
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h3><strong>Fabrication or Falsification</strong></h3>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Fabrication or falsification occurs when a
      student invents or distorts the origin or content of information used as
      authority. Examples include:</span></p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Citing a source that does not exist</span>
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Citing information from a source that is
          not included in the source for which credit is given</span></p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Citing a source for a secondary
          proposition that it does not support</span></p>
    </li>
    <li><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Using code from another site without giving
        source credit to the original author.</span></li>
  </ul>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h3><strong>Cheating</strong></h3>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">A student cheats when he or she attempts to
      give the appearance of a level of knowledge or skill that has not been
      obtained. Examples include:</span></p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Using unauthorized materials during an
          examination or while completing an assignment, this includes artificial
          intelligence technologies such as ChatGPT</span></p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Collaborating on an examination or
          assignment without authorization</span></p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Taking an examination or completing an
          assignment for another, or permitting another to take an examination or
          to complete an assignment that is not his or her own</span></p>
    </li>
    <li><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Using code you did not write to speed up
        development</span></li>
    <li><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Using a library without permission</span>
    </li>
    <li><span style="font-size: 14pt;">using a Framework without permission</span>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h3><strong>Other Misconduct</strong></h3>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Other academic misconduct includes other
      academically dishonest, deceitful, or inappropriate acts which are
      intentionally committed. Examples include:</span></p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Obtaining or providing to another a test
          or answers</span></p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Submitting the same work for more than one
          class without disclosure and approval. There are many classes you can
          take where you may work on your resume/CV. If you have worked on it in
          another course your instructor needs to know that is where you are
          starting from and not creating it from scratch. Your instructor will
          give you guidance as to what to do.</span></p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Getting equal credit on group assignments
          when equal work was not done</span></p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Using content from a previous/other class
          in your current class.</span></p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Using artificial intelligence technologies
          to help or do your work as a student. The list of AI tools is too long
          to list all of them. Just know that you are not allowed to use them for
          anything that you submit for grading.</span></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>I get this question all the time: <span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Are Libraries and Frameworks allowed in this class:
      </strong><span
        style="font-size: 18.6667px;"><strong>Generally NO</strong></span></p>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">You will be given permission to use code from
      two specific websites in weeks 10 and 12. You will be able to use that and
      only that in this course. </span></p>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Do not use CSS frameworks in part or full.
      Students have tried to use individual rules from Bootstrap, Foundations, and
      Material CSS in my class. Do not do it, I have been using these myself in my
      profession so I recognize them very quickly.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I will allow you to use icons from Hero Icons
      ( <a href="https://heroicons.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
        https://heroicons.com </a> ) and Box Icons ( <a
        href="https://boxicons.com" target="_blank"
        rel="noopener">https://boxicons.com</a> ) for icons to be used in your
      final project. You must copy the SVG code of the icons into your code or
      make them images you reference. You will not be permitted to use them as
      font icons. This means no Font Awesome allowed. Font Awesome does not pass
      CSS validation and you will loose points for that, so I do not allow
      it.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">The only JavaScript that will be allowed in
      this course will come from Week 10 and Week 12. Week 10 you are given some
      code to simulated submitting a form and week 12 you get to choose a web
      component from W3Schools website to use in your final project. Some of these
      components have JavaScript requirements to make them work. If your
      JavaScript does not come from one of those two places, you are not allowed
      to use it.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">If any of you have questions about this please
      let me know.</span></p>
