  <p> I wanted to show you all what kind of a site you will be creating. If you
    follow the instructions correctly, the site will look kind of like this
    image. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> All pages on this site do work. You will have similar pages. The site plan
    will be created in week 2 </p>

  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> My site has a few things not in the instructions that I modified so you
    cannot just use it. For example if you look at the logo and navigation bar,
    it looks like an oar. </p>
