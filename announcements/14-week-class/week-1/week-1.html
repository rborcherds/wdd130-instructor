  <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I know some of you will feel overwhelmed by
      all the new terminology that you will be learning. Do not get discouraged,
      it will come with some time and practice. Most students start to understand
      this by week 4 and others it will take till weeks 10 to 13 to truly
      understand this.</span></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">There are a lot of international students
      attending BYU-Idaho. I know a lot of you will think that words are spelled
      incorrectly. For the USA, they are spelled correctly.&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Here are some examples:</span></p>
  <table style="border-collapse: collapse; width: 26.1705%; height: 273px;"

  <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>FYI: </strong>If you find something
      that does not make sense make sure to ask for clarifications. The
      instructions get updated on a regular basis and may not be worded in a way
      that you will understand them.&nbsp;<br /></span></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2><strong><span style="color: #050b77;">Your responsibilities</span></strong>
  </h2>
  <p><span style="color: #d70505;">You are responsible to read all Announcements.
      Announcements will clarify or change the instructions</span>. I have a lot
    of helps and suggestion in the announcements and in the weekly Discussion
    Boards. I also give instructions in some weeks on how to make it easier to
    submit your homework as the instructions are not clear on how to do
    that.&nbsp;</p>
  <p><span style="color: #d70505;">You must check your feedback on each graded
      assignment to see how to improve your work</span>. Each weeks submissions,
    starting in week 2, builds on the previous week. This means that if you do not
    fix something, it will affect future weeks. The quiz on Steps for Success will
    teach you how to check your feedback.</p>
  <p>You MUST follow the instructions word for word. If you skim them you will
    miss important information and struggle with the course material. <span
      style="color: #d70505;">Web development is a very detail oriented profession
      and I am a stickler for the details</span>. More details on how the
    instructions are written in a Week 4 announcement.</p>
  <p>Procrastination is an enemy in this class. Do not wait till the last day of
    the week to do the homework. You may not get it done on time. There are at
    least 2 due dates each week. There is a 5% per day late penalty, so if you
    miss a due date in the middle of the week, you will loose points.</p>
  <p><span style="color: #dd0d0d;">You must create the folders according to the
      instructions</span>. This means you create a wdd130 folder and inside that
    folder you will have all the HTML and CSS code for this class. <strong>Windows
      Users do not put this inside the OneDrive folder as that creates issues for
      a lot of students.</strong> <span style="color: #0d087e;"><strong>Folder and
        file names must be lowercase, no spaces and no underline</strong></span>.
    Use a hyphen if you want to separate two words. The no underline makes it
    easier to troubleshoot when debugging the code. I give examples of this latter
    in the semester.</p>
  <h2><strong><span style="color: #050b77;">Grading Policy</span></strong></h2>
  <p>I allow re-submission until the due date without any penalty. Anything
    submitted after the due date/time you will receive a 5% penalty per day until
    you get a zero, this does include re-submissions. Submit early and you will
    have a chance to fix the issues and resubmit by the due date to get 100% on
    the assignment. For example if you submit your homework on Wednesday, I will
    have time to grade it and you can resubmit it by Saturday to fix anything you
    got incorrect. If you submit on Saturday and you resubmit on Monday, you will
    loose up to 10% of the points on the re-submission.</p>
  <p>As a professional web developer, late work is unacceptable, client prefer
    early. This is a great habit to get into.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2><strong><span style="color: #050b77;">Error messages in
        VSC</span></strong><strong><span style="color: #050b77;">ode or with
        GitHub commands</span></strong></h2>
  <p>I give you this info now because a lot of you will start week 2 before the
    Welcome to week 2 announcement.</p>
  <p>Take a screenshot of the error and post it into the Discussion Forum only. I
    will post how to fix that error. If the fix is not easy or I need more info, I
    will request a Zoom call so that I can see what is going on. I will record
    that session and post it as part of the answer. This way everyone can learn.
    Do not wait to install the software needed and setup GitHub. I do document all
    errors and I have the link to my GitHub page with Git/GitHub errors in the
    Welcome to Week 2 Announcement.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>*********************************************************</p>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Before I get into what you will be doing this
      week I want to share with you some truths about learning. This is something
      that I learned years ago and it has helped. There are a couple of scriptures
      I want to point you too. The first thing you need to understand is that all
      truth belongs to the doctrine of the kingdom. President Brigham Young taught
      "If you can find a truth in heaven, earth or hell, it belongs to our
      doctrine. We believe it; it is ours; we claim it" (DBY, 2). This does not
      mean just spiritual knowledge but secular knowledge as well.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">The first scripture is found in
      <strong>D&amp;C 88:77-79</strong>. In these versus we find the commandment
      about gaining an education and how to teach one-another.&nbsp;</span></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">77 And I give unto you a commandment that
        you shall teach one another the doctrine of the kingdom.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">78 Teach ye diligently and my grace shall
        attend you, that you may be instructed more perfectly in theory, in
        principle, in doctrine, in the law of the gospel, in all things that
        pertain unto the kingdom of God, that are expedient for you to
        understand;</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">79 Of things both in heaven and in the
        earth, and under the earth; things which have been, things which are,
        things which must shortly come to pass; things which are at home, things
        which are abroad; the wars and the perplexities of the nations, and the
        judgments which are on the land; and a knowledge also of countries and of
        kingdoms</span></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Verse 79 gives us a great list of things to
      learn in our lifetime. Think of the terminology used to day for each items
      in that list: "In the heavens" for example are things like astronomy, space
      flight, satellites, etc.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Notice it does not say to pick one or two
      things but to learn all. &nbsp;This is one of BYU-Idaho's principles,
      teaching you to become a lifelong learner.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">The second scripture is found in <strong>Alma
        37:8</strong>. This is when Alma is explaining to his son Helaman about
      the writing on the plates and what his charge will be in keeping the record
      of his people. Verse 8 gives us a very helpful piece of information about
      how we can retain what we learn. I am bolding the part of the scripture I
      will be focusing on.</span></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">8 And now, it has hitherto been wisdom in
        God that these things should be preserved; for behold, <strong>they have
          enlarged the memory of this people</strong>, yea, and convinced many of
        the error of their ways, and brought them to the knowledge of their God
        unto the salvation of their souls.</span></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">The word <strong>THEY</strong> is referring to
      the scriptures that Alma has been talking about. In other words, by studying
      the scriptures, you will be blessed with a greater memory and be able to
      recall things to your mind. I promise you, if you keep studying the
      scriptures everyday along with your school work, you will be able to
      remember more and do better in school. It will take time to show your
      faithfulness to be able to get this blessing.</span></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2><span style="color: #081470;">What we will be doing this week</span></h2>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">There are two quizzes this week.</span></p>
  <ul>
    <li><span style="font-size: 14pt;">The first quiz is <strong>Steps for
          Success.</strong> This quiz takes you through the important aspects of
        the way the class is setup and some of the expectations.&nbsp;</span></li>
    <li><span style="font-size: 14pt;">The second quiz is the <strong>Preparation
          quiz</strong>. You have to watch about 20 minutes of videos before
        taking the quiz as the quiz questions come from the 4 videos.</span></li>
  </ul>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">You will then setup your code editor. For this
      class we will be install Microsoft Visual Code editor.&nbsp; This is
      commonly refereed to as VSCode/VS-Code/VS Code. I do 90% of my professional
      development using this code editor.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Once you have the code editor installed you
      will jump right into creating your first HTML page. You will be creating an
      About Me page. This page tells the other class members who you are. You will
      then post the output of this page as an image into W01 Icebreaker: Getting
      to Know You discussion board. You will then have to respond to other
      students and try to make connections with them.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14pt; color: #ba372a;">Do Not Install the Prettier
      extension as per the instructions. It is an Opinionated Formatter that still
      uses old formatting rules from over 10 years ago.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">My About Me page is posted into the discussion
      board. as your&nbsp; first post using the Reply button at the top of the
      page.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Yours will not be as fancy and formatted as
      mine. My post is an example of what to put into your page.</span></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2><strong><span style="color: #081470;">Additional Helps for the
        class</span></strong></h2>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I highly recommend you install a browser
      extension called FireShot. This extension allows you to capture an entire
      web page as an image in PNG format. Firefox has its own screen grab utility
      you can utilize.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">The Chrome extension (works in Microsoft Edge)
      can be found by going here: &nbsp;<a
        href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/take-webpage-screenshots/mcbpblocgmgfnpjjppndjkmgjaogfceg?hl=en"
        target="_blank"
        rel="noopener">https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/take-webpage-screenshots/mcbpblocgmgfnpjjppndjkmgjaogfceg?hl=en</a></span>
  </p>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">The Firefox extension can be found here <a
        href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/fireshot/"
        target="_blank"
        rel="noopener">https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/fireshot/</a></span>
  </p>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">If you are going to be taking the web
      development and design classes from BYU-Idaho, quite a few of the classes
      will ask you to make screen shots of the web pages you are creating. The
      FireShot extension will make it so much easier to create them. Fireshot is
      free to use the basic features.</span></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">You may also use the <strong>built in snip-it
        tools in Windows and MacOS</strong>. &nbsp;Read these articles on how to
      use them:&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Windows: <a
        href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/use-snipping-tool-to-capture-screenshots-00246869-1843-655f-f220-97299b865f6b"
        target="_blank"
        rel="noopener">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/use-snipping-tool-to-capture-screenshots-00246869-1843-655f-f220-97299b865f6b</a></span>
  </p>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">MacOS: <a
        href="https://www.geeky-gadgets.com/snipping-tool-on-mac-29-06-2021/"
        target="_blank"
        rel="noopener">https://www.geeky-gadgets.com/snipping-tool-on-mac-29-06-2021/</a></span>
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Another program I highly recommend is called
      <strong>Flameshot</strong>: <a href="https://flameshot.org/" target="_blank"
        rel="noopener">https://flameshot.org/</a> - This runs on Windows, Mac,
      Linux.&nbsp; You can add things like arrows to your screenshots before you
      save them.</span></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Some announcements will be open for
        comments, mainly the spiritual thought/question for the
        week</strong>.&nbsp; Please post all other questions, comments, etc about
      the course in the Discussion Forum for the week. I prefer that all question
      about the course or your homework be posted in the discussion forum so
      everyone can learn from the questions. I answer these every evening.</span>
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Personal issues you must e-mail me
        using Canvas only</strong>. Do not use my BYU-Idaho e-mail address for
      course questions. I do not respond to the BYU-Idaho outlook email as fast as
      I do the course e-mail system in Canvas.</span></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2><span style="color: #081470;">Spiritual Thought/Question for the Week</span>
  </h2>
  <p><span style="color: #b50b0b; font-size: 14pt;">What is your favorite
      scripture about education and why?</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Post it as a comment to this announcement.
      Posting here is optional, but you should at least write it down in your
      journal or in Gospel Library in the notes section. There is a question every
      week.</span></p>
