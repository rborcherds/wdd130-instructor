    <h2> VSCode is updated by Microsoft every month. Make sure you update the
      software. </h2>
    <p> Looks for the shortcut keys link for your operating system in the
      troubleshooting document. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h2>GitHub</h2>
    <p> A few things about GitHub and what I am seeing students do that are
      creating issues. </p>
    <ul>
      <li> DO NOT edit any files on the GitHub server directly. Only edit in
        VSCode and push to GitHub. If you edit on GitHub, you will create a
        problem for yourself that is not quick to fix. </li>
      <li> You must maintain a folder/directory structure. All development will
        require a folder/directory structure. I constantly work on projects that
        start with 30,847 files in 5,051 folder/directories using a PHP
        Framework. This is the only way to keep a project this large in check
        and manageable. </li>
      <li> You must learn to read the error message and learn to know what parts
        to look at to figure out how to find the answers. In VSCode you must
        display the Terminal Window <br>
        <img

          alt="Togle Terminal">
        <br>
        <br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Select the OUTPUT screen</p>
    <p>
      <img
        src="https://borcherds-ralph.github.io/wdd130/announcements/images/vscode-select-output.png"
        alt="Select Output Tab">
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p> Change to the Git output screen. First click the drop down and select
      GIT from the list. This list shows the various extensions that can give
      output errors to this screen that you have installed. Do not just install
      the extensions you see in my list. Only install extensions you must have
      to do your work. They do slow down the startup time. </p>
    <p>
      <img
        src="https://borcherds-ralph.github.io/wdd130/announcements/images/vscode-git-output.png"
        alt="Git Output Option">
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p> This screen will show all the git commands issues and the output from
      that command. Error message will be in this screen. The most recent
      command run will be at the bottom of the output lists. You can copy the
      error directly from this screen to post into a Google Search or post in
      the Discussion Forum each week. I highly recommend you post your errors in
      the Discussion Forum each week if you have any errors. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h2>Validation</h2>
    <p> Remember to always validate your HTML and CSS. You must learn to read
      those errors if you get them. Each of these errors gives you a starting
      place for the error. Sometimes you will get multiple errors because of one
      item. Some errors in the CSS file will point to the end of the CSS rule
      where the error is. You must check the entire rule for the error. If the
      error points the the rule name, the error could be in the rule above or
      the name itself. Reading errors is a skill and you must learn this skill
      if you are to become a developer in any language. </p>

    <p> You can install this browser extension that has a lot of tools for web
      development; <a href="https://chrispederick.com/work/web-developer/"

    <p> You can use what is called a Booklet or Favelet.&nbsp; These are
      JavaScript code saved as a bookmark in your browser. Every browser has a
      method to add/edit bookmarks. Right click on the bookmark bar at the top
      of the browser and select ADD BOOKMARK or BOOKMARK MANAGER or something
      similar.&nbsp; </p>
    <p> Once in the ADD BOOKMARK screen, Put the code in the URL location and
      the name in the NAME field. </p>
