        <h2>Personal Site Grading</h2>
        <p>Starting in week 5, the grading for the personal site shows a
            checkmark or an X if the assignment is not done. The issue is that
            even tough you have a checkmark, you may not have received full
            points. This is the way the system works.</p>
        <p>Grades are calculated on the points earned for these assignments, not
            if they were done or not. The only way to know if you missed any
            points is to look at the rubric. Make sure to check the Rubric every
            time to make sure you got all the points on the assignment.</p>
        <h3>How grades are calculated</h3>
        <p>This is how grades are calculated in a weighted grading class.</p>
        <p>Take all the points earned in each section and calculate the
            percentage</p>
        <p>For WDD130 this is the point breakdown:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Preparation quizzes - 70 points - 10%</li>
            <li>Rafting Website Assignments - 150 points - 34%</li>
            <li>Ponder Assignments - 120 points - 13%</li>
            <li>Personal Website Assignments - 250 points - 43%</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Lets say you have the following points to total</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Preparation quizzes - 65 / 70 points</li>
            <li>Rafting Website Assignments - 140 / 150 points</li>
            <li>Ponder Assignments - 120/120 points</li>
            <li>Personal Website Assignments - 200 / 250 points</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You calculate it like this</p>
        <ul>
            <li>65 / 70 = .92857 * .1 = .092857 * 100 = 9.2857 points</li>
            <li>140/150 = .93333 * .34 = .317333 * 100 = 31.733 points</li>
            <li>120 / 120 = 1 * .13 = .13 * 100 = 13 points</li>
            <li>200 / 250 = 0.8 * .43 = .344 * 100 = 34.4 points</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You then add the totals for each category</p>
        <p>9.2857 + 31.733 + 13 + 34.4 = 88.4187%</p>
        <p>Your grade will be 88.42% or a B+</p>
        <p>A lot of classes are calculated in this manner. It can help bring
            your grade up or down depending on how well you do in each area.</p>
