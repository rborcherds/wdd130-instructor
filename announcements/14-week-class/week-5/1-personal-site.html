    <span style="font-size: 14pt;"> As you are starting to work on your personal
      site site-plan, I wanted to share with you an example of a personal site
      and finished site-plan. </span>
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>
    <span style="font-size: 14pt;"> Here is the pitch/purpose for the site.
    </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span style="font-size: 12pt;"> "Create a website that showcases the pioneer
      trek from April 2022. This trek was attended by the stakes of Yucca Valley
      and Victorville. This site will explain what is a pioneer trek, what types
      of activities where done on the trek and what inspirational stories were
      told to the youth. This site will be more of an overview of what occurred.
      It will also have a couple of videos, a bunch of images of the youth
      dressed in pioneer era clothing, pulling handcarts, and ding the other
      activities." </span>
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>
    <span style="font-size: 14pt;"> Here is a link to my GitHub pages site so
      you can look at the site and the site-plan. You will be doing something
      very similar. </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span style="font-size: 14pt;"> FYI: The link to the positioning assignment
      shows the blank assignment. No answers are given. </span>
  </p>

    </span>
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>
    <span style="font-size: 14pt;"> I did make a few modifications to the
      site-plan to accomplish what I wanted. I added a 3rd accent colors and
      changed the alignment. I also change the default sizes for the heading
      tags. </span>
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>
    <span style="font-size: 14pt;"> I kept the wireframes to the most basic of
      layouts to illustrate how basic they can be and still be valid for this
      class as an example. You will notice that no real text was use and not
      images were used in the wireframe. The wireframe is supposed to depict the
      general layout of the page. You will create wireframes during weeks 8
      &amp; 9. </span>
