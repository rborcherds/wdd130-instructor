        <h2>
                <span style="color: #081470;"><strong>What to expect this
                                week</strong></span>
        </h2>
        <p>
                <span style="font-size: 14pt;"> This week you will start to look
                        at what you can do with Fonts and their properties and
                        the spacing around various elements on a web
                        page.<strong> I have two more announcements on this
                                topic with more details during the
                                week.</strong>
                        <strong></strong></span>
        </p>
        <ul>
                <li>
                        <span style="font-size: 14pt;">You start the week
                                watching 2 videos. The first is on the Box Model
                                and the second on the Browser Development Tools.
                                You will become very familiar with the browser
                                development tools as all web development classes
                                use them to help you debug issues.</span>
                </li>
                <li>
                        <span style="font-size: 14pt;">You will do an activity
                                <strong>Box Model Practice</strong> where you
                                practice the margin, padding, border properties
                                for every single element in your HTML
                                page.</span>
                </li>
                <li>
                        <span style="font-size: 14pt;">This weeks
                                <strong>Challenge </strong>activity is where you
                                try to duplicate the image shown in the
                                challenge instructions. The images are provided
                                for you. </span>
                </li>
                <li>
                        <span style="font-size: 14pt;"></span> You will write an
                        elevator pitch on the website you want to create from
                        weeks 7 to 14. More on this further down in the
                        announcement. You do submit this for grading and review
                        to make sure it will meet the requirements.</span>
                </li>
                <li>
                        <span style="font-size: 14pt;">You then have your weekly
                                assignment of <strong>CSS - Fonts and
                                        Spacing.</strong> The instructions give
                                you a list of Web Safe fonts. While those are
                                generally accepted as the safe fonts, not all
                                systems have them by default. For example a
                                Windows machine that does not install Microsoft
                                Office does not have the Helvetica font.
                                Smartphones do not have those fonts either. It
                                is always better to use Google Fonts or similar services for web development. In the workplace you may host your own
                                fonts on your server.</span>
                </li>
                <li>
                        <span style="font-size: 14pt;">This wee you will give
                                feedback to the Instructor. The feedback you
                                give this week is not used by the school. This
                                feedback is for the instructor personally to let
                                them know what they can do to be a better
                                instructor for you.</span>

        <h3>
                <span style="color: #dd0d0d;"><strong>Starting on your Personal
                                Website Idea</strong></span>
        </h3>
        <p>
                <span style="font-size: 14pt;"> This week you will have to
                        create an elevator pitch for your personal website . You
                        will submit the pitch about the website idea. Start
                        early on this so that you will have the time to complete
                        it correctly.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
                <span style="font-size: 14pt;"> This is the way the pitch needs
                        to be written and must be 75 to 100 words. What would
                        you say in 60 seconds on the idea.</span>
        </p>
        <ol>
                <li>
                        <span style="font-size: 14pt;">Start with the idea of "I
                                am going to create a website that
                                does/shows/teaches/ etc"&nbsp; Do not do a pitch
                                for a company as a whole. This is about your
                                website only.</span>
                </li>
                <li>
                        <span style="font-size: 14pt;">To come up with the idea
                                think about it like these 2 examples stating
                                questions. </span>
                        <ol>
                                <li>
                                        <span style="font-size: 14pt;">You are
                                                with a few friends and you want
                                                to teach them something you
                                                enjoy. What is that idea and how
                                                would you go about putting that
                                                onto a web site.</span>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                        <span style="font-size: 14pt;">You have
                                                a hobby you enjoy. What is it
                                                and how would you explain it to
                                                other people.</span>
                                </li>
                        </ol>

        </ol>
        <p>
                <span style="font-size: 14pt;"> The idea cannot be an
                        e-commerce, research gathering, something that will
                        require a database, blog type site or forums/discussion
                        type site.</span>

                        church that gives you the most hope, comfort, peace,
                        etc? Why do you feel that way about it?</span>
        </p>
        <p>
                <span style="font-size: 14pt;"> For me it is that families are
                        eternal and that we will see our family members again in
                        the future. My father was murdered in his own home in
                        May 2010. This one teaching is the one brings the most
                        peace in dealing with the death of a family
                        member.</span>
