    <p> This is a post that explains why you need to move the loading of the
      Stylesheet to after the &lt;title&gt; tag. If you do not care just make
      sure that the loading of the stylesheet is in the correct place. A lot of
      the info in this announcement is something that you will only use outside
      of school work. If you are going to get the social media certificate, this
      will be good info to know to help with social media tracking. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>A lot of you have done something like this</p>
    <pre>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;<br>&lt;html lang="en"&gt;<br>&lt;head&gt;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="styles/style.css"&gt;</strong><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"&gt;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;title&gt;Whitewater Rafting Vacations | Dry Oar Boating | Home&lt;/title&gt;<br>&lt;/head&gt;<br>&lt;body&gt;</pre>
    <p>&nbsp;or you have done this</p>
    <pre>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;<br>&lt;html lang="en"&gt;<br>&lt;head&gt;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"&gt;<br>   &nbsp;<strong>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="styles/style.css"&gt;</strong> <br>    &lt;title&gt;Whitewater Rafting Vacations | Dry Oar Boating | Home&lt;/title&gt;<br>&lt;/head&gt;<br>&lt;body&gt;</pre>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p> The correct way to format your &lt;head&gt; area is like this with the
      link to the stylesheet after the &lt;title&gt; tag. </p>
    <pre>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;<br>&lt;html lang="en"&gt;<br>&lt;head&gt;<br>  &nbsp; <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"&gt;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;title&gt;Whitewater Rafting Vacations | Dry Oar Boating | Home&lt;/title&gt;<br>    <strong>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="styles/style.css"&gt;</strong><br>&lt;/head&gt;<br>&lt;body&gt;</pre>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p> As you learn more about what can and does go into the &lt;head&gt; area
      of an HTML file, you will notice that there is a lot of confusion in this.
      The thing you have to keep in mind is this. </p>
    <p> Stylesheets must load after the the &lt;title&gt; and the meta data that
      defines the type of text on the page and before the JavaScript files which
      you will learn about in a few weeks. Some of the meta data tells the
      browser what type of document, language and encoding to use with what is
      being loaded. If the browser does not know this info then you can get some
      unexpected results. This is especially true when working with multiple
      languages around the world. For example Japanese and Chinese browsers
      default to UTF-16 &amp; UTF-32 to display characters on the screen. This
      can lead to unexpected display issues. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
      <strong>This is additional Information</strong> . You can read about the
      default &lt;meta&gt; tags here: <a
        href="https://www.w3docs.com/learn-html/html-meta-tag.html"
        target="_blank" rel="noopener">
        https://www.w3docs.com/learn-html/html-meta-tag.html </a>
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p> There are a lot of&lt;meta&gt; type tags that are placed in the
      &lt;head&gt; tag. You will learn most of these on the job as they are not
      taught in many classes, even online classes/tutorials as they are specific to the project
      you are working on. </p>
    <p>Here is the definition of the &lt;meta&gt; tag:</p>
    <pre>The <span class="tag">&lt;meta&gt;</span> tag contains metadata, which specifies page description, keywords, author of the document, etc. The metadata is used by browsers, search engines, and other web services, and isn&rsquo;t displayed on the web page. A web document can contain more than one <span class="tag">&lt;meta&gt;</span> tag, but generally, the physical appearance of the document is not affected by it.&nbsp;</pre>
    <p> With this definition in mind, you can see why search engines look to
      this tag in the &lt;head&gt; area. CSS and JavaScript can override these
      things and for that reason they should always be loaded after all the
      other tags in the &lt;head&gt; area. </p>
    <p> There are other tags that are used for Social Media linking. Such as
      OpenGraph by Facebook and the Twitter tags. You can read the details here:
