  <h2>
    <strong> Text properties you will learn about and may or may not use on your
      pages. </strong>
  </h2>
  <p> Text Color, alignment, decoration, transform, shadow, indentation, letter
    spacing, line height, word spacing. </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Text color</strong> &nbsp;is just that. You set the color of the
    text in CSS.&nbsp; for example:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; color: #cecece;
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Text align</strong> ment has four values:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Left (text-align: left) - aligns the text to the left</li>
    <li>Right (text-align: right) - aligns the text to the right</li>
    <li>Center (text-align: center) - puts the text in center of the page</li>
    <li> Justify (text-align: justify) - stretches the line of text to align
      both the left and right ends (like in magazines and newspapers) </li>
  </ul>
  <p> This is the rule that is taught to the COMM and ART students about
    alignment.&nbsp;This comes from the book for the class,&nbsp;
    <strong>Non-Designers Design Book, 3rd Edition</strong> . </p>
  <p> "Nothing should be placed on the page arbitrarily. Every element should
    have some visual connection with another element on the page. This creates a
    clean, sophisticated, fresh look." </p>
  <p> It all comes down to readability. Keep the lines no longer than 76
    characters and make sure everything is linked to something else on the page.
    COMM-130 and ART-230 teach these concepts in quite a bit of detail. Left
    justify everything unless specifically told to do otherwise in the
    instructions or you have a good reason besides "I think it looks good." </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>
    <strong>Text-decoration</strong> &nbsp;property is used to specify line
    decorations added to the text. The following values are valid for
    text-decoration property.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li> Overline (text-decoration:overline) - each line of text has a line over
      it </li>
    <li> Underline (text-decoration:underline) - each line text is underlined
    </li>
    <li> Line-through (text-decoration:line-through) - each line of text has a
      line going through it similar to strike-through. </li>
    <li>None (text-decoration:none) - no text decoration is applied</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    <strong>Text-transform</strong> &nbsp;property has the following values:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li> Uppercase (text-transform: uppercase) - converts all characters to
      uppercase </li>
    <li> Lowercase (text-transform: lowercase) - converts all characters to
      lowercase </li>
    <li> Capitalize (text-transform: capitalize) - converts the first character
      of each word to uppercase </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    <strong>Text-shadow</strong> &nbsp;property is used when you want to give a
    shadow effect to your text. Here is a great example of it being used. &nbsp;

      target="_blank" rel="noopener">
      https://www.w3docs.com/css3-maker/text-shadow </a>
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Text-indent</strong> ation property is used for specifying the
    length of empty space of the first line in a text block. The values below
    are valid for this property:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li> Length , which specifies the indentation in px, pt, cm, em, etc. The
      default value is 0. Negative values are allowed. </li>
    <li> Percentage - which Specifies the indentation in percentage of the width
      of the containing block. </li>
    <li> Each-line, when the indentation affects the first line as well as each
      line after a forced line break, but does not affect lines after a soft
      wrap break. </li>
    <li> Hanging, which inverts which lines are indented. The first line is not
      indented. </li>
    <li>Initial, which makes the property use its default value.</li>
    <li> Inherit, which inherits the property from its parent&rsquo;s element.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    <strong>Text letter-spacing</strong> &nbsp;property allows to define the
    spaces between letters/characters in a text
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Text line-height</strong> &nbsp;property defines the how tall the
    line height will be.&nbsp; For example this is like stating single spaced
    lines vs double spaced lines and more.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Text word-spacing</strong> &nbsp;property we can change the space
    between the words in a piece of text, not the individual characters.
  </p>
