  <p>
    <span>
      <strong>font-family</strong> &nbsp;- This is the font we use for specific
      text. </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>
      <strong>font-style</strong> &nbsp;- This is normal, italics, or oblique
      which leans the text a little more than italics </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>
      <strong>font-size</strong> &nbsp;- This is how big you want the text
      denoted as px, em, or rem </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>
      <strong>font-weight</strong> &nbsp;- is how you set bold for
      example.&nbsp; The font weight can be a number from 100 to 900, in 100
      increments, if the font supports it. Not all fonts support all weights.
      You have to know the font. 100 is very thin lines where 900 is the
      thickest lines for each letter.&nbsp; Bold is normally 700. Normal is 400
    </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>
      <strong>font-variant</strong> &nbsp;- This allows you to use small-caps on
      text. All letters are uppercase but the first letter of each word is
      normal size and the rest of the word is uppercase but the height of
      lowercase letters.&nbsp; <a class="external"

    <span> This image below&nbsp; shows 3 sans-serif fonts at 200 px tall. You
      can see the difference in the actual size of the font. This is something
      that you will have to contend with as a web developer. Sometimes a 14px
      font size looks to be 16px font size or the reverse. I lined them up along
      the top edge of the letter.&nbsp; Art 230 goes into a lot more detail
      about this issue and how it affects typography. </span>
