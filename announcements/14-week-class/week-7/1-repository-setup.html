        <span style="color: #d70505;">DO NOT</span> CREATE A NEW REPOSITORY FOR
        PERSONAL SITE. <br>
      </strong>
    </span>
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>
    <span style="font-size: 14pt;"> All files for this class must be in one
      single repository. Starting with Week 1 the instructions have always said
      to create a folder or file under the wdd130 folder you created for all you
      work in Week 1. </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span style="font-size: 14pt;"> Here is an image of the basic structure of
      what you should have. I did not list all the images that you
      should/could/may in this image. </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span style="font-size: 14pt;"> This folder and file structure is the basics
      of what you should have by the end of Week 7.&nbsp; The folder name
      personal-site-folder in this image is a placeholder. <br>
    </span>

  <p>
    <span style="font-size: 14pt;"> The aboutme folder and contents was create
      in week 1 </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span style="font-size: 14pt;"> the wwr folder was created in week 2 along
      with the site-plan-rafting.html file. The index.html file in the root
      folder (3rd from the bottom) was created in week 2 during the GitHub and
      Pages setup. </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span style="font-size: 14pt;"> Week 3 you created the index.html file in
      the wrr folder </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span style="font-size: 14pt;"> Week 4 you created the styles/styles.css
      file under the wwr folder </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span style="font-size: 14pt;"> Week 7 you created the personal-site-folder
      using your own site name with the site-plan files </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span style="font-size: 14pt;"> The challenges folder is for all the work
      you did not turn in for grading. </span>
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>
    <span style="font-size: 14pt;"> If you folder structure does not look like
      this, you need to get it looking like this. <strong>All school work must
        be in one repository.</strong>
