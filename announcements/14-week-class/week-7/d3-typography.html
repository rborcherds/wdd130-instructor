  <p>
    <span style="font-size: 14pt;"> I am noticing quite a few of you making some
      basic and normal errors in your font setup for your personal site. I will
      be letting you know of issues or potential issues as I see them. Most of
      my comments will come from the study of typography and use in developing
      sites for clients. <br>
    </span>
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>
    <span style="font-size: 14pt; color: #d70505;"> Remember there are 2 videos
      in the Week 2 Site Plan instructions on Typography. Those are a good
      reminder videos on the basics and how to use Google Fonts. </span>
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>
    <span style="font-size: 14pt;"> A great article to read is: <a
        href="https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/ui-design/beginners-guide-to-typography/"
        target="_blank" rel="noopener">
        https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/ui-design/beginners-guide-to-typography/
      </a> &nbsp; This should take about 15 minutes to read. </span>
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>
    <span style="font-size: 14pt;"> I highly recommend you watch these 2 videos
      to start with. This is from a course on Envato+ that was created in 2014
      about web typography. Typography does not change a lot in the concepts and
      theory as quickly as other things do, so old classes and articles are
      still relevant. <br>
    </span>
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>
    <span style="font-size: 14pt;"> This is part 1 of a 12 part course that is
      available for free about typography. </span>
  </p>

  </p>
  <p>
    <span style="font-size: 14pt;"> To watch all the videos you need to go to
      the Envato+ website. This full course is over 2 hours long in 11
      lessons.&nbsp; The lesson titled <strong>
        <span style="color: #050b77;">2.3 Fonts on the Web</span>
      </strong> will also be useful. You have to go to their site to watch that
      video. This is the link to the first lesson, same as the first video
      above. </span>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>
    <span style="font-size: 14pt;"> Another good video from Envato+.&nbsp; This
      video is 39 minutes long. <br>
    </span>

    <span style="font-size: 14pt;">
      <iframe title="YouTube video player"
        src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yAuUDyUC-GM" width="560" height="315"
        allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"

    </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span style="font-size: 14pt;"> This video will tell you to download things
      from the Envato+ website. Keep in mind that they are trying to sell you
      things and you do not need to download what they ask you to download. They
      do have good resources but most of them do cost money. I only share things
      that you can do for free. </span>
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>
    <span style="font-size: 14pt;"> There are a lot of resources on YouTube to
      show you how to use fonts. Be careful with videos that are specific to a
      product. There are quite a few that are about using typography in
      WordPress themes for example. Do not watch those. There are also a lot
      around products like Figma, Photoshop, Illustrator, etc. They may be
      useful but you need to understand how to apply to your application.
