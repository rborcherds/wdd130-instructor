    <p>A number of you have your email address in your wireframes or in the text
        of your website. This is a bad practice. Marketing people will tell you
        to do this while security people will tell you not to do this. Here is
        the run down as to why this is bad. Most of this text comes from a
        variety of articles I found on the web. I am using parts of them and not
        the entire articles as they do a very good job explain the various
        parts. This is put into 1 article for you to read.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>This first section is why it is a bad idea.</p>
    <h2 class="blue"><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Email harvesting: how
                spambots stalk their prey</span></strong></h2>
    <p><strong>Email harvesting</strong> is the automated acquisition of email
        addresses for unfair advertising, phishing attacks, or spreading
        malicious software, and is usually software-supported. For this purpose,
        specialized programs (known as &lsquo;email harvesters&rsquo;) search
        websites, mailing lists, internet forums, or social media platforms for
        email addresses. The characteristic syntax, which corresponds to all
        email addresses, delivers the sought-after contact information. Simple
        search patterns in a website&rsquo;s source text search for @ signs.
        This sign is not normally found in natural texts, but is used in email
        addresses to separate the username and domain from each other.
        Transcribing the address provides little protection. More refined
        spambots can even search for popular alternative spellings such as [at],
        [AT], (at), (AT):</p>
    <p><em>User@domain.com</em></p>
    <p><em>User[at]domain.com</em></p>
    <p>If the @ sign or its equivalent contains two special characters separated
        by a dot, this is a clear indication for the harvester that this is an
        email address. <strong>Even changing the 'dot' in front of the top-level
            domain</strong> offers comparatively little protection and makes it
        harder to read: </p>
    <p>User[AT]domain[DOT]com</p>
    <p>Even more revealing than the @ sign, is the <strong>HTML email
            link</strong> 'mailto:user@domain.com'. This allows website visitors
        to open their preferred email program with a simple click. The recipient
        address is automatically copied to the corresponding field. This is
        practical, but still doesn&rsquo;t stop the spambots from realizing this
        is an email address. Website operators are therefore advised not to use
        traditional patterns when it comes to providing contact options. At the
        same time, human site visitors should still be able to read the address
        so they can easily contact you if they need to. </p>
    <h2 class="blue"><span style="color: #ff0000;">Classic representation of the
            email address without protection</span>
    </h2>
    <p>The typical way that an eMail address is displayed on the web is by using
        code like this</p>
    <pre class="line-numbers language-mixed code-toolbar" data-language="mixed"
        data-trimmed="true">             <code class="rainbow language-mixed rb1">&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions or suggestions, please write an email to:                   &lt;a href="mailto:user@domain.com"&gt;user@domain.com&lt;/a&gt;.>&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
    <p>It displays like this:</p>
    <p><em>If you have any questions or suggestions, please write an email to:
            <u>user@domain.com</u></em>.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h3><strong><span style="color: #c16d03ff;">Here is how you can put your email
                address on the web and be safer from these
                harvesters.</span></strong></h3>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Method 1</p>
    <h4><span style="color: #0810a1;"><strong>Integrate email address as a
                graphic</strong></span></h4>
    <p>If an email address is implemented as a graphic, it can still be read by
        the human eye, but texts written as graphics are hard for email
        harvesters to recognize. Occasionally there are spambots that are able
        to convert image elements into text elements using OCR (<strong>Optical
            Character Recognition</strong>), but this isn&rsquo;t common.
        Including corresponding contact information as a graphic therefore
        offers a comparatively high protection against spam. However, website
        operators must realize that these can limit the user-friendliness of
        their website. The following HTML code shows how an <strong>email
            address can be integrated into a website as a graphic file</strong>:
    </p>
    <pre class="line-numbers language-mixed code-toolbar" data-language="mixed"
        data-trimmed="true"><code class="rainbow language-mixed rb2">&lt;img src="Path/graphicfile.png" with="120" height="20" alt= If you have any questions or suggestions, <br>please write an email to: user@domain.com"&gt;</code></pre>
    <p>This will display a graphic such as this:</p>
    <p><img role="presentation"
            src="https://www.ionos.com/digitalguide/fileadmin/DigitalGuide/Screenshots/EN-email-adresse-geschuetzt-email-als-grafik.PNG"
            alt=""></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>it is difficult for most users to manually type an email address, text
        information in the form of a graphic is often not available for users
        with visual impairment. Therefore, it makes sense to include a
        <strong>description of the graphic as alt text</strong>. These can be
        read out be screen readers, but the downside is that spambots can read
        them as well so this method alone is not recommended as a preventative
        measure against spam. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Method 2</p>
    <h4><strong><span style="color: #0810a1;">HTML email link via
                redirect</span></strong>
    </h4>
    <p>In order to effectively protect email addresses from harvesters,
        it&rsquo;s a good idea to separate them from the website. A script is
        generally used, which redirects human users to the <em>mailto</em> link
        after the first click. This opens the user&rsquo;s email program and
        displays the address. For spambots that scan the source code of a
        website, this link will look like a file link and therefore prevents
        automatic reading. This is much harder to do with just straight HTML and
        CSS. This is much easier to implement with scripting languages such as
        PHP.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Method 3</p>
    <h4 class="blue"><span style="color: #0810a1;"><strong>Masking the email
                address</strong></span></h4>
    <p>If you don&rsquo;t want to completely replace an email address with a
        graphic or a <em>mailto</em> link, there are alternative strategies.
        They make it possible to code an email address by masking additional
        elements or first compiling them in the browser using
        <strong>JavaScript</strong>. Simple encoding can be implemented by
        <strong>HTML entities</strong>, for example, as well as by <strong>URL
            or HEX encoding</strong>. Simple masking strategies rely on the
        comments feature, HTML elements, and <strong>CSS</strong>. A bit more
        complex, however, is to mask an email by <strong>dynamically
            composing</strong> the address. </p>
    <p>Simply transcribing characters means that these methods are limited to
        manipulating the address in the source code and therefore not affecting
        how it is displayed in the browser.</p>
    <h4><span style="color: #0810a1;">Masking by character encoding</span></h4>
    <p>Common character encoding, used when masking email addresses in the
        source code, is based on <strong>HTML entities</strong>, <strong>HEX
            code</strong>, or the <strong>percentage of URL encodings</strong>.
        These descriptions were originally developed for representing special
        characters through standard characters. For masking email addresses,
        this type of encoding is suitable because the respective reference
        characters are automatically translated in the browser view. If the
        characters of the email address <em>user@domain.com</em> are masked
        using <strong>HTML entities</strong>, they are first written in the
        alternative style. </p>
    <p><em>&amp;commat; = @</em></p>
    <p><em>&amp;period; = . (dot)</em></p>
    <p>This results in the following source code:</p>
    <pre>&lt;p&gt; If you have any questions or suggestions, please write an email to:
      &lt;a href="mailto:user&amp;commat;domain&amp;period;com"&gt; user&amp;commat;domain&amp;period;com&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
    <p>Since HTML entities have only been defined for special characters, this
        means that with this character encoding, neither the entire email
        address nor the significant text string <em>mailto:</em> can be
        encrypted. Alternatively, a representation using HEX encoding is
        possible. The Unicode character number is used here and is listed in the
        following basic schema: </p>
    <p><em>&amp;#characternumber;</em></p>
    <p>Typically, the hex number of the corresponding character is indicated by
        a small 'x'. Thus the letter 'm' could be noted down as '&amp;#x6d;' or
        decimal '&amp;#109;'. The email address <em>user@domain.com</em>
        including the <em>mailto</em> link will look like this: </p>
    <pre>&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions or suggestions, please write an
    &lt;a href="&amp;#x6d;&amp;#x61;&amp;#x69;&amp;#x6c;&amp;#x74;&amp;#x6f;&amp;#x3a;&amp;#x62;&amp;#x65;&amp;#x6e;&amp;#x75;&amp;#x74;&amp;#x7a;&amp;#x65;&amp;#x72;&amp;#x40;&amp;#x64;&amp;#x6f;&amp;#x6d;&amp;#x61;&amp;#x69; &amp;#x6e;&amp;#x2e;&amp;#x64;&amp;#x65;"&gt;email&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;p&gt;</pre>
    <p>The corresponding <strong>reference characters</strong> for translating
        an email address can be easily found from lists available online. A
        clear overview is provided on <a
            title="Detailed HTML character reference list on htmlarrows.com"
            href="http://htmlarrows.com/symbols/" target="_blank"
            rel="noopener">htmlarrows.com</a>. If you want to encode the
        complete email address, we recommend <strong>encoding programs</strong>
        that are offered free of charge as web applications on numerous
        websites.</p>
    <h4><span style="color: #0810a1;"><strong>Masking by
                supplementing</strong></span></h4>
    <p>Basically, it is possible to hide email addresses from spambots by
        inserting additional characters into them. Programs will then hopefully
        not see the address as a whole and therefore it won&rsquo;t be able to
        be read out automatically. <strong>HTML comments</strong> provide a
        simple way to do this. </p>
    <p><em>&lt;!-- Comment --&gt;</em></p>
    <p>Ideally, these include just the characters that are normally used in
        email addresses. </p>
    <p><em>&lt;!-- abc@def --&gt;</em></p>
    <p><em>&lt;!-- @abc.com --&gt;</em></p>
    <p>If comments like these are added into the email address, spambots (who
        scan the website) will stumble across the following code:</p>
    <pre>&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions or suggestions, please write an email to:
    us&lt;!-- abc@def --&gt;er@domai&lt;!-- @abc.com --&gt;n.com.
    &lt;p&gt;</pre>
    <p>In the browser view, however, the HTML comments are invisible.</p>
    <p>Alternatively, it is possible to insert any characters without comments,
        as long as they are <strong>hidden in the browser view using
            CSS</strong>. In the following example, the email address is
        interrupted by a <em>span</em> element. The content between the start
        and the end tag isn&rsquo;t considered because of the <em>display</em>
        quality along with the value <em>none</em>. </p>
    <pre>&lt;style type="text/css"&gt;
    span.spamprotection {display:none;}
    &lt;/style&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;If you have any questions or suggestions, please write an email to:
    user&lt;span class="spamprotection"&gt;CHARACTER SEQUENCE&lt;/span&gt;@domain.com.
    &lt;/p&gt;</pre>
    <p>While a human user receives a correct email address in the web browser, a
        spambot is expected to read out the blended text in the <em>span</em>
        element. This gives website operators the option to use the email
        address <em>userCHARACTERSEQUENCE@domain.com</em> as a so-called
        <strong>honeypot</strong> in order to locate sender addresses and block
        them from spam attacks. </p>
    <p>A disadvantage of masking by supplementing is that with this method the
        email address can&rsquo;t be connected with an HTML email link. In this
        case, users must manually copy the address into their email program.
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Method 4</p>
    <h4><strong><span style="color: #0810a1;">Reversing a string</span></strong>
    </h4>
    <p>CSS can be used not only to hide additional characters in the source
        code, but also to <strong>reverse the string</strong>. This enables
        website operators to store email addresses in the wrong order in the
        source code in order to deceive spambots. </p>
    <pre class="line-numbers language-mixed code-toolbar" data-language="mixed"
        data-trimmed="true"><code class="rainbow language-mixed rb10"><span id="rb10ln1" class="line" data-line="1"></span>&lt;style type="text/css"&gt;
    <span id="rb10ln2" class="line" data-line="2"></span>span.ltrText {unicode-bidi: bidi-override; direction: rtl}
    <span id="rb10ln3" class="line" data-line="3"></span>&lt;/style&gt;
    <span id="rb10ln4" class="line" data-line="4"></span>&lt;p&gt;If you have any questions or suggestions, please write an email to:
    <span id="rb10ln5" class="line" data-line="5"></span>&lt;span class="ltrText"&gt; moc.niamod@resu&lt;/span&gt;.
    <span id="rb10ln6" class="line" data-line="6"></span>&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
    <p>While spambots find the character string <em>moc.niamod@resu</em> in the
        source code, the CSS property <em>unicode-bidi</em> ensures (along with
        the value <em>bidi-override</em>) that all characters within the
        appropriately distinguished <em>span</em> elements are read by the
        browser just as the quality <em>direction</em> intends them to be
        &ndash; in this case from right to left (rtl). </p>
    <p>This masking means that email addresses aren&rsquo;t displayed as they
        usually are. However, more advanced spambots can&rsquo;t be deceived by
        this trick.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>There are more ways but they are out of scope for what you are allowed to
        do in this class. JavaScript code is a very common process to hide email
        addresses. You will learn more about how to do that once you have
        learned how to write JavaScript code so you can modify code from the
        internet on how to do this.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Content Management Systems (CMS) such as WordPress have plug-ins that
        will do this for you in a variety of ways. If you ever use one of those
        systems, make sure you use an email obfuscation plug-in to help protect
        your email address</p>
