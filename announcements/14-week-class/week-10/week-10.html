  <h2>
    <strong><span style="color: #0810a1;">What to Expect</span></strong>
  </h2>
  <h3><strong>HTML FORMS</strong></h3>
  <p>
    <span style="font-size: 14pt;"> You will also learn about HTML forms. This
      exercise is a very basic form with a response. Pay close attention to the
      details of how the form is created and read the instructions carefully.
      Read each step first then do the what it says. Step 2 in Canvas tells you
      to add some JavaScript code to the page below the FORM element. The FORM
      element starts with &lt;form .....&gt; and ends with &lt;/form&gt;. You
      add the code below the closing tag. </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span style="font-size: 14pt;"> There are 3 ways to create labels for your
      forms. The exercise teaches the implicit way. You need to get used to
      doing them the explicit way and this is the way I want you to create them
      in your project. </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span style="font-size: 14pt;">
      <strong>This is the implicit way</strong>
    </span>
  </p>
  <pre><span style="font-size: 14pt;">&lt;label&gt;Name &lt;input type="text" name="name"&gt;
    &lt;/label&gt;</span></pre>
  <p>
    <span style="font-size: 14pt;">
      <strong> This is the explicit way and the method I want you to use.
      </strong>
    </span>
  </p>
  <pre><span style="font-size: 14pt;">&lt;label <span style="color: #ff0000;">for="name"</span>&gt;Name&lt;/label&gt;
    &lt;input type="text" <span style="color: #ff0000;">id="name"</span> name="name"&gt;</span></pre>
  <p>
    <span style="font-size: 14pt;"> The <span
        style="color: #ff0000;">for=</span> in the label has to match the <span
        style="color: #ff0000;">id=</span> name in the input. Remember in week 2
      and 3 you learned that the ID has to be unique in an HTML page. This is
      one reason why. </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span style="font-size: 14pt;"> The explicit method for doing the labels
      works the best for accessibility readers (For example: visually impaired
      users / screen readers for blind people ). </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span style="font-size: 14pt;">
      <strong> The third way is to do placehoder for the label which is not
        recommended for readability </strong> . You can use this to give example
      of the format for an input such as Phone Number, Zip/Postal Code format,
      number format, etc. with either of the above options as well. Just add the
      placeholder property. </span>
  </p>
  <pre><span style="font-size: 14pt;">&lt;input type="text" id="name" name="name" placeholder="Name"&gt;</span></pre>
  <p>
    <br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span style="font-size: 14pt;"> A couple of other things you can do to your
      forms that make a difference. Use the required option to make the field
      required for submission and the first field you want to have typed in use
      the autofocus property. Here is an example where this will be where the
      cursor starts on the form and it is required. You will learn a lot more
      about these properties in WDD-230. </span>
  </p>
  <pre><span style="font-size: 14pt;">&lt;input type="text" name="myInput" autofocus required&gt;</span></pre>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>
    <span style="font-size: 14pt;"> I am giving you links to two great articles
      about creating forms now. I do not expect you to use the content in them
      until you create your personal site. If you want to use the same
      JavaScript from this weeks Forms lesson, let me know by the beginning of
      Week 11 what the form URL is and I will tell you what to modify in the
      JavaScript, if anything, so that it will work to simulate submitting the
      form. Glitch does not allow the submission of forms on their system. You
      will learn how to do that in WDD-230 and e-mail the form and in other web
      development classes how to save it to a database. </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <br>
    <br>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span style="font-size: 14pt;"> These things listed in these articles are to
      help you design better forms and get you used to the process. Most of
      these best practices are used in WDD-230. </span>

  <h2>
    <span style="color: #0810a1;"><strong>Research Paper</strong></span>
  </h2>
  <p> This week you will do a study on Careers in Web Design and Development.
    You will have to research 3 to 4 jobs and how much they pay. Then write a
    200 word or more response answering the following questions: </p>
  <ul>
    <li> "What did you learn from the websites on careers in web design and
      development?" </li>
    <li>"What did you learn from this class in general?"</li>
  </ul>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h3>
    <span style="color: #0810a1;"><strong>Personal Site HTML</strong></span>
  </h3>
  <p> This week you will write all the HTML for all 3 pages of your personal
    site. No need to get into the CSS yet. Start to code this as soon as
    possible. I would recommend spending at least 20 min each day working on one
    page at a time doing the HTML coding. Submit the HTML code as soon as
    possible during the week to get feedback if there are any issues with the
    structure. The important items for this is to have a structure that follows
    the basic HTML5 format. You can add the class names to the HTML as you write
    it at this point or you can come back and add them when you start your CSS
    coding. Make sure you close all your semantic HTML tags correctly and in the
    correct order. I have seen a few issues with that on the additional Dry Oar
    pages. </p>
  <pre></pre>
  <p>Here is a great flowchart for HTML5 tags and when to use them.</p>

  <h2>
    <span style="color: #0810a1;"><strong>Future weeks</strong></span>
  </h2>
  <p> You will spend most of your time on your personal site during Week 10 and
    11. Week 12 you do have a graded discussion board were you will post a link
    to your personal site to get feedback from fellow students. <strong> There
      will be no late posts allowed in that discussion board. </strong>
  </p>
  <p> Getting to the point of being able to post that link will take some time
    so plan accordingly. Try to post that link early.You should be able to post
    that link as soon as you finish the styling in week 11. Do not wait for your
    submission in Week 11 to be graded for this discussion board in week 12.
    Feel free to work on this as fast as you want and get that posted. If you
    have that site done go ahead and post the link now. </p>

  <h2>
    <span style="color: #0810a1;"> Spiritual Thought/Question for the Week
    </span>
  </h2>
  <p>
    <span style="font-size: 14pt;"> What is your understanding of the ordinance
      done in the temple and why we do them? </span>
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <span style="font-size: 14pt;"> Baptism and Confirmation for the dead
      </span>
    </li>
    <li><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Initiatory and endowment</span></li>
    <li>
      <span style="font-size: 14pt;"> Sealing - Husband and wife and children to
        the parents </span>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    <span style="font-size: 14pt;"> You can refer to Chapter 27 for ordinance
      for the Living &amp; 28 for ordinances for the deceased in the General
      Handbook of Instruction. Sealing policies are found in Chapter 38 section
      4 of the handbook. </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span style="font-size: 14pt;"> Do not discuss specific wording of the
      ordinances. </span>
  </p>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Post your thoughts below</span></p>
