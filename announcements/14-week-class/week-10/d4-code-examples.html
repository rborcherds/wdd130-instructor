  <p> These links to code examples from requests that students have made
    in previous semesters. </p>
  <p> This first one lets you play with color hues. The way it works is you
    adjust the CSS --color and --l variables. This uses the HSL color codes. You
    can use this website to get the numbers. &nbsp; <a
      href="https://hslpicker.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
      https://hslpicker.com/ </a> &nbsp; <strong>Look at the HSLA color</strong>
    and only use the first 3 percent numbers. You put the first 2 in the --color
    variable and the last percent number into the --l variable. </p>
  <p> The Lorem Ipsum text is 15% darker and the background is 15% lighter than
    the starting color. </p>

  <p> This next example shows you have to do the first letter very large script
    like the old text used to have the first letter of a chapter very large and
    in color. I did not add color but you can. </p>

    </a>
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> This next example shows various navigation layouts with the logo in the
    middle. This uses grid layout for the nav area. </p>
  <p>

    </a>
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> This next example shows how to use stars to create something like a star
    rating and also the chevron icons. </p>
  <p>
    <a href="https://borcherds-ralph.github.io/wdd130/examples/stars.html"
      target="_blank" rel="noopener">

  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> This next one is the business hours example I had in my video. This shows
    the same info displayed using the &lt;table&gt; tag, Flex and Grid layout
    methods. </p>
  <p>
    <a href="https://borcherds-ralph.github.io/wdd130/examples/table-grid-flex.html"
      target="_blank" rel="noopener">
      https://borcherds-ralph.github.io/wdd130/examples/table-grid-flex.html
    </a>
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> This last one I did not create but I wanted to point it out. This uses
    Flex to display all the various input types for forms. A lot of them require
    JavaScript to work correctly. Use this to see what the various input options
    are and get an idea of how to use them. </p>
  <p>

  </p>
  <p> This does use the Bootstrap CSS Framework for a lot of the styling along
    with 6 other CSS files from other sites. Click on the gear icon in the CSS
    section (top right of the box) and you can see the URL's for the other CSS
    files. There are 8 JavaScript libraries used along with the custom code to
    make some of these work. You will notice that Bootstrap has JavaScript
    library. This is one of the reasons I do not like Bootstrap, you have to
    load their JavaScript library to make a lot of things work in Bootstrap.
    This makes it a lot more complicated to work with. There are 3 JavaScript
    libraries loaded in the HTML config area as well. </p>
  <p> I am going to be creating a grid layout version of this page and I may
    simplify the JavaScript libraries if I recreate the CSS. I have not decided
    on that yet. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p> If there are other examples please let me know as I will be happy to
    create them. </p>
