  <p> There are a few things I wish to correct and explain from the HTML of the
    Dry Oar website. Please use these in your personal site. Most of these have
    already been submitted to the course designer to fix for future classes.
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> You will find developers using things incorrectly all the time. You need
    to know where to find the correct answers. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> All of these come from <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML"
      target="_blank" rel="noopener"> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML
    </a>
    site. Expand the Reference -&gt; HTML Elements area and you will see all the
    HTML tags. There are tags with a red trash icon next to them. Those are tags
    that have been removed from the specification and you cannot use them.&nbsp;
    When in question about a tag name, use this list as a resource. </p>

  <h3>&lt;br&gt; Tag</h3>
  <p> Never use &lt;br&gt; to separate paragraphs. The &lt;br&gt; is only to be
    used when doing something like and address or make new lines in displaying a
    poem. REad this article for more info: <a

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h3>Heading Tags (h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6)</h3>
  <p>
    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Heading_Elements"
      target="_blank" rel="noopener">
      https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Heading_Elements
    </a>
  </p>
  <p> Usage notes Heading information can be used by user agents to construct a
    table of contents for a document automatically.&nbsp; <br>
    <strong> Avoid using heading elements to resize text. Instead, use the CSS
      font-size property. (Do not wrap &lt;a href&gt; tags inside of heading
      tags.) </strong>
    <br> Avoid skipping heading levels: always start from &lt;h1&gt;, followed
    by &lt;h2&gt;and so on.&nbsp; <br> Use only one &lt;h1&gt;per page or view.
    It should concisely describe the overall purpose of the content.
  </p>
  <p>
    <span style="font-size: 14pt; color: #cf0202ff;">
      <strong> If you do wrap an &lt;a href&gt; tag with a heading tag I will
        have you remove it. You must use standard CSS styling. I would recommend
        putting a class name on the link to style it. The course material did
        not follow this rule. </strong>
    </span>
    <strong></strong>
  </p>
  <h3>&lt;section&gt; Tag</h3>
  <p>
    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/section"
      target="_blank" rel="noopener">
      https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/section </a>
  </p>
  <p> Use this if you have text that can stand on its own, it is related to the
    content of the page and has a heading tag. Use h2 to h6 tags in this section
    only. If you do not have a heading tag, then you should use some other tag
    such as &lt;article&gt;, &lt;aside&gt; or &lt;div&gt;. </p>
  <p> If you are only using the element as a styling wrapper, use a &lt;div&gt;.
    An unwritten rule is that <span style="color: #0000ff;">
      <strong> a &lt;section&gt; should logically appear in the outline of a
        document </strong>
    </span> . </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h3>&lt;article&gt; tag</h3>
  <p>
    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/article"
      target="_blank" rel="noopener">
      https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/article </a>
  </p>
  <p> A few of you are planning on creating a BLOG page. This is the perfect
    place to use the &lt;article&gt; tag. </p>
  <p> A given document can have multiple articles in it; for example, on a blog
    that shows the text of each article one after another as the reader scrolls,
    each post would be contained in an <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> element,
    possibly with one or more <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> s within. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h3>&lt;address&gt; tag</h3>
  <p>
    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/address"
      target="_blank" rel="noopener">
      https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/address </a>
  </p>
  <p> Read this article carefully and look at the examples. This is one place
    you can use the &lt;br&gt; tag correctly. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h3>&lt;nav&gt; tag</h3>
  <p>
    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/nav"
      target="_blank" rel="noopener">
      https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/nav </a>
  </p>
  <p> It's not necessary for all links to be contained in a &lt;nav&gt; element.
    <strong> &lt;nav&gt; is intended only for major block of navigation links;
    </strong> typically <span style="color: #0000ff;"> the &lt;footer&gt;
      element often has a list of links that don't need to be in a &lt;nav&gt;
      element </span> .
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h3>&lt;main&gt; tag</h3>
  <p>
    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/main"
      target="_blank" rel="noopener">
      https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/main </a>
  </p>
  <p> The content of a &lt;main&gt; element should be unique to the document.
    Content that is repeated across a set of documents or document sections such
    as sidebars, navigation links, copyright information, site logos, and search
    forms shouldn't be included unless the search form is the main function of
    the page. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h3>&lt;header&gt; tag</h3>
  <p>
    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/header"
      target="_blank" rel="noopener">
      https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/header </a>
  </p>
  <p> The &lt;header&gt; element is not sectioning content and therefore does
    not introduce a new section in the outline. </p>
  <p> In this class, this tag holds the logo and navigation bar at the top of
    the page. You could use it in other places to denote the &lt;header&gt; of a
    section or article. For ARIA specification, which you will learn on your
    own, the &lt;header&gt; is a page banner section of text to help a screen
    reader know that this is at the top of that section/page. </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h3>&lt;footer&gt; tag</h3>
  <p>
    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/footer"
      target="_blank" rel="noopener">
      https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/footer </a>
  </p>
  <p> The &lt;footer&gt; element represents a footer for its nearest ancestor
    sectioning content or sectioning root element. The footer is just that. The
    end of the section, article, page. </p>
  <p> One of the best ways to format a footer is to use a color that is not used
    on the page to denote the end of the page. Also make sure you have good
    color contrast and the text in the footer is easy to read. </p>
  <p> This article does a great job explaining a page footer and ways to use it
    well: &nbsp; <a

    </a>
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h3>&lt;div&gt; tag</h3>
  <p>
    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/div"
      target="_blank" rel="noopener">
      https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/div </a>
  </p>
  <p> As a "pure" container, the &lt;div&gt; element does not inherently
    represent anything. Instead, it's used to group content so it can be easily
    styled using the class or id attributes, marking a section of a document as
    being written in a different language (using the lang attribute), and so on.
