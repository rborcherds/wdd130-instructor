<body>
  <p>I want to recommend an extension for all of you you that are or will be
    taking more development classes.</p>
  <p>This extension is called Project Manager. It will allow you to switch between
    your development projects without having to go to FILE - OPEN FOLDER every
    time.</p>
  <p>To install this extension click on the Extensions Icon on the left. It is
    this icon <img
      src="https://borcherds-ralph.github.io/wdd130/announcements/images/extension-icon.png"
      alt="VSCode Extension Icon" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>In the search bar at the top type in "Project Manager" and the extension
    should show in the top couple options.</p>
  <p><img
      src="https://borcherds-ralph.github.io/wdd130/announcements/images/project-manager-search.png"
      alt="Project Manager" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>click on the listing and then select Install in the search results or on the
    page that is displayed.</p>
  <p><img
      src="https://borcherds-ralph.github.io/wdd130/announcements/images/descrption-install.png"
      alt="install button" /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OR &nbsp; &nbsp; <img
      src="https://borcherds-ralph.github.io/wdd130/announcements/images/search-install.png"
      alt="search install button" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Once it is installed you will see a new icon in the Left Bar. <img
      src="https://borcherds-ralph.github.io/wdd130/announcements/images/project-manager-icon.png"
      alt="Project Manager Icon" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>When you click on it for the first time there will be a button that will let
    you save the current project as your first project.</p>
  <p>You should see a blue button that states: Project <strong>Manager: Save
      Project -</strong> Click that button and you will be prompted for a name at
    the top center of the screen. The default name is the folder name.</p>
  <p><img
      src="//borcherds-ralph.github.io/wdd130/announcements/images/project-manager-1st-save.png"
      alt="PM Save 1" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>That will then add that project name to the Project Manager list of projects.
  </p>
  <p>After you have saved the first one, to save more projects, you open the
    project and click the save icon at the top of the Project Manager list of
    projects. The red arrow is pointing to the save icon.&nbsp; This is a small
    list of my projects I have/currently work on.</p>

      alt="Project Manager Save" /></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h3><strong>Advanced Topic</strong></h3>
  <p>If you click the edit icon, looks like a pencil, it will open the JSON file
    that lists your projects. The format is quite easy to follow. The rule is that
    each project must be enclosed with { } and must have a comma between the
    project section.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <pre
        class="list-bullet-30"><strong>Name</strong> is the name of the project</pre>
    </li>
    <li>
      <pre
        class="list-bullet-30"><strong>Rootpath</strong> is the path to the project.</pre>
    </li>
    <li>
      <pre
        class="list-bullet-30"><strong>Paths</strong> is not used at this time</pre>
    </li>
    <li>
      <pre
        class="list-bullet-30"><strong>Tags</strong> is a way to categorize the type of project for sorting. This list is up to the person</pre>
    </li>
    <li>
      <pre
        class="list-bullet-30"><strong>Enabled</strong> is if the project will display or not in the list of projects. This is a way to only show projects you are currently working on.</pre>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <code>{
  	"name": "WDD-130",
  	"rootPath": "/var/www/html/school/wdd130",
  	"paths": [],
  	"tags": ["School", "WDD-130"],
  	"enabled": true
  },</code>
  <p>The last project does not have a , (comma) after the closing }</p>
  <p>Let me know if you have any other questions about this extension in the
    discussion forum.</p>
