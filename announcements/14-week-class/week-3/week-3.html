    <h3><strong><span style="color: #050b77;">As we start this week I would
                like to reiterate a few points from last
                week.</span></strong></h3>
    <ol>
        <li><span style="font-size: 14pt;">The fonts you use on a website
                says a lot about the company and the message you want to
                portray. If you want some good example of font pairing go
                to: <a href="https://www.typewolf.com/" target="_blank"
                    rel="noopener">https://www.typewolf.com/</a>&nbsp; and
                take a look. Be forewarned that you can waste hours here.
                There are a lot of YouTube videos and articles written about
                good typography. Just search for them for more ideas. Try to
                keep the fonts you use to the ones available of <a
                    href="https://fonts.google.com" target="_blank"
                    rel="noopener">https://fonts.google.com</a>&nbsp; as
                those are the most commonly used on the web.</span></li>
        <li><span style="font-size: 14pt;">We did a very basic site plan and
                style guide for this class. Here are a couple more examples
                of style guides that include site plans. These are just to
                show you how diverse a web design can be and to give you
                inspiration for the future. The process to do these are not
                set in stone</span>
            <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><a
                        href="https://www.canva.com/learn/apple-google-starbucks-inside-the-web-design-style-guides-of-10-famous-companies/"

    <h2><strong><span style="color: #050b77;">Now for this weeks
                work</span></strong></h2>
    <ol>
        <li><span style="font-size: 14pt;">You must watch the videos and
                take the quiz in the Preparations Material. This will give
                you an overview of the things you will be learning this
                week.</span></li>
        <li><span style="font-size: 14pt;">You will then have a Practice
                activity where you will learn about CLASS and ID selectors.
                It is important that you know how both of these work. For
                this course, I want you to use the CLASS selector for the
                majority of items. The ID selector has some negative things
                about it. You cover those in WDD-331 Advanced CSS
                class.</span>
        </li>
        <li><span style="font-size: 14pt;">You then have an activity Working
                with Wireframes. In this assignment there is a link to an
                article as W3Schools.com about HTML5 Semantic Elements. Make
                sure you ask questions in the developer forum if you do not
                understand them. I personally like this website for the
                HTML5 tags: <a
                    href="https://www.w3docs.com/learn-html/html5-elements-reference.html"
                    target="_blank"
                    rel="noopener">https://www.w3docs.com/learn-html/html5-elements-reference.html</a>.
                This is a brief explanation of the tags. Do a search using
                this syntax:&nbsp; mdn &lt;tag name&gt;, for example "mdn
                bdi". One of the first links should be to the
                devloper.mozilla.org website for the bdi tag. This is
                technical explanation of the tag with example of use.</span>
        </li>
        <li><span style="font-size: 14pt;">You will then have an activity on
                troubleshooting. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>This
                        is a very important activity</strong></span>. You
                must validate all your work before you submit it for
                grading. </span></li>
        <li><span style="font-size: 14pt;">You then have an activity where
                you learn what a Frontend Developer is and what types of
                jobs they do.</span></li>
        <li><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Now you start on the HTML for
                your Home Page. assignment. There is a Rubric which is a
                grid that explains how this assignment is graded. Make sure
                you do not miss any steps or fail to do part of a step.
                Doing so will create issues in coming weeks. I will refer
                you back to the step you missed to fix. There are 2 videos
                you need to watch about images and how to optimize them for
                web display. For example, your smartphone will take images
                that are over 1MB in size. Ideal web image sizes are less
                than 200kb each. You will notice that we use JPG and PNG
                image files for the most part in the instructions. If you
                have an image in any of the other formats you are welcome to
                use them, WebP, JPEG, and SVG. <span
                    style="color: #0810a1;">DO NOT USE: bmp, ico, tiff
                    images. </span>This will be submitted for grading</span>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h2><strong><span style="color: #050b77;">A few reminders on what to
                do/look for in your coding.</span></strong>
    </h2>
    <ol>
        <li><span style="font-size: 14pt;">You must use semantic HTML5 tags.
                Please refer to this page for a refresher on HTML5
                https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/semantic-html5-elements/.
                This site was not in your reading but it explains things in
                a slightly different manner and I believe it has better
                examples. Be careful on how you use DIV tags. They can add
                unnecessary complexity to your web page.</span>
        </li>
        <li><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Make sure your images are large
                enough to meet the requirements of the Rubric at the bottom
                of the assignment page. You will use 3 images and 3
                headlines. The one image has to go all the way across the
                width of your page. That will be at lest 960 pixels wide.
                There are links to images you can use in the
                instructions.<br></span>
        </li>
        <li><span style="font-size: 14pt;">You will not be adding any colors
                or other styling to the page this week. If you do work
                ahead, which is fine, pleas submit the way the page looks at
                the end of this assignment. The system will take a screen
                shot of the assignment so I can see what it looked like. I
                will then look at the HTML code to make sure you are using
                semantic HTML. Not using the correct HTML at this point will
                affect your grade latter on in the class. It is a double
                whammy on the grading.</span>
        </li>
        <li><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Pay attention to the written
                details in the instructions.</span></li>
    </ol>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h2><span style="color: #050b77;"><strong>Feedback</strong></span>
    </h2>
    <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">As we go along with these assignments,
            I will be very direct with my feedback. It is nothing personal
            towards any one of you. There are two types of feedback you need
            to learn about. You will be giving feedback to other students in
            almost every class you take in one form or another at BYU-Idaho.
            There is constructive and destructive criticism. I will always
            do my best to give you constructive criticism. If you do not
            understand the feedback I give you, times I will use terms that
            are common but you may not understand the meaning of the
            term</strong>. Ask so you can learn. I may suggest things to do
            with your code now that will not make sense. I make these
            suggestions to help get your mind in a mode that will make
            learning other principles easier in the future.</span></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I am a web developer for clients as
            part of my everyday work. Feedback from clients can be very
            harsh. <br></span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">When it comes to web development, the
            smallest details matter. Let me give you an example from a
            website I coded for someone about 5 years ago. This was done in
            WordPress, which I do not use or recommend. This client was not
            nice about the feedback and they way they communicated back to
            me.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 14pt;">The design I was
            given had the following type of icon in it with the arrow
            pointing to the right.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><img role="presentation"
                src="//borcherds-ralph.github.io/wdd130/announcements/images/document.png"
                alt="" width="200" height="189"></span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">The customer was not happy with the
            way the icon and text that was to the right of the icon ended up
            looking like on the web. The first line of text was not directly
            in line with the arrow. Based upon how much text there was, the
            starting of the text moved higher and higher towards the top of
            the icon. Because of the way alignment works on the web, what
            they were asking was not possible. This type of alignment
            changes on various devices, which was another issue for the
            client. The desktop had the arrow and text to the right and the
            cell phone did not have the text to the right because the icon
            was above the text on the cell phone.</span>
    </p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">To make the client happy, the icon was
            changed to be one without the little arrow on all
            devices.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><img role="presentation"
                src="//borcherds-ralph.github.io/wdd130/announcements/images/document2.png"
                alt="" width="200" height="200"></span></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Even though they accepted the original
            design thinking the web was exactly as a graphics program, which
            was done the way they thought it should be. The designer did not
            know about the limitation on the web for alignment. This created
            an issue that I ended up having to deal with. For the client it
            was a visual thing only. It did not allow for their OCD
            (Obsessive Compulsive Disorder) personality to accept the way it
            worked by default.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">You will have people like this to deal
            with in any type of designing that you end up doing. I have
            found this to be a part of web development life.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">These small details matter and the
            better you can get at identifying the details the fewer changes
            you will have to make to the layout of the page to make your
            clients/bosses happy with the design.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I give detailed feedback as often as I
            can like this. Pay attention to it.&nbsp; A lot of the feedback
            is in the comments on your submissions.</span>
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h2><span style="color: #d70505;"><strong>Spiritual Thought/Question for
                the Week</strong></span></h2>
