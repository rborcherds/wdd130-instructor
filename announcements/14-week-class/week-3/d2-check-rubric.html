    <h2>How to check Rubric Grading</h2>
    <p>Starting in Week 6, the Rubric grading will be used a lot for feedback.</p>
    <p>The first thing to do is to go to your grades</p>
    <p><img src="//rborcherds.github.io/wdd130-instructor/announcements/images/rubric-grade-link.png"
            alt="Grade Link" /></p>
    <p>Then find the assignment and click the Rubric icon</p>
    <p><img src="//rborcherds.github.io/wdd130-instructor/announcements/images/rubric-link.png"
            alt="Rubric Link Icon" /></p>
    <p>This will expand the rubric. This image shows all 3 things you need to look
        at.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The first thing to look at is to make sure that there is a grade on
            every line. If not let the instructor know. Every once in a while a
            option does not get recorded correctly.</li>
        <li>The next thing to look for is the graded items that do not have a full
            score. Look at the wording in the full score option and see what what
            graded</li>
        <li>The look at the comment for those items you do not have a full score.
            Those are the items you need to work on.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><img src="//rborcherds.github.io/wdd130-instructor/announcements/images/rubric.png"
            alt="Rubric" /></p>
    <p>There may be other comments under the comments icon. that is the icon with
        the talk bubbles and there is usually a number in that icon. Read those
        comments as well.</p>
