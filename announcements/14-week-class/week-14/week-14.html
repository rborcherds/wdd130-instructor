    <strong>Congratulations on making it to the end.</strong>

  <p>
    <span style="font-size: 14pt;"> Remember that final submissions have to be
      done by Wednesday Night <strong></strong>
      <span style="color: #8d0000;">
        <strong>Wednesday, April 5 @</strong> 11:59 PM MDT </span>
    </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span style="font-size: 14pt;"> If you have any issues finishing up your
      final project please contact me sooner than latter. I cannot accept any
      submissions after the class closes. All submissions have to be done
      through the i-Learn/Canvas portal. </span>
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>
    <span style="font-size: 14pt;">
      <span style="color: #7d0f0f;"> The final report and submission of your
        entire site is worth 100 points. </span> Attached to this announcement
      is an example file report. This report uses Lorem Ipsum text&nbsp; for the
      body and the headings are there to show you each section. </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span style="font-size: 14pt;"> All items from the Rubric must be easily
      understood. A lot of students miss easy points for not making sure each
      item is complete and correct. Here are the requirements for the report and
      they are also in the instructions. </span>
