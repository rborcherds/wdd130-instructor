    <h2>Welcome to Week 5</h2>
    <p>This week you will read a talk from Elder Uchtdorf.&nbsp; This is an article to
        help you think about sharing the gospel online. You will have a few questions to
        answer</p>
    <p>You will then be learning about the <strong><span style="color: #ba372a;">HTML
                table element</span></strong>. This table tag is one that used to be used
        for all web page layouts in the 1994 to 1997 time of the web. It was the only way
        to get half decent looking page layouts. Back then there were very few graphics
        being used in the HTML.</p>
    <p>You will then learn about creating <strong><span style="color: #ba372a;">HTML
                forms</span></strong>. Forms are used anytime you have to get input from
        the user. Every website has at least 1 form on the site. A simple login page,
        registration page, sign-up for a newsletter, contact us page are all example of
        the use of the form tag.</p>
    <p>You will then <span style="color: #ba372a;"><strong>learn about styling the
                forms</strong></span>. Styling forms is very important. You will learn
        about the styling for input layouts. In future classes you will also learn to
        style display forms. The way you style the is different.</p>
    <p><span style="color: #ba372a;"><strong>You will then create a quiz
                form</strong></span>. This is a very basic way that you can create
        questions and input for a quiz. You will not be processing the quiz in this class
        as that is for a future class once you have learned JavaScript as well.</p>
    <h3><span style="color: #0d087e;"><strong>Submitted Work</strong></span></h3>
    <p><span style="color: #ba372a;"><strong>You will create the Contact Us page for the
                Rafting Site</strong></span>. Make sure to pay close attention to how this
        is done. You will make a copy of the About Us file and then remove the contents
        from the &lt;main&gt; area and then recreate that content.</p>
    <p>Remember that the title is not allowed to be the same on any page of a website and
        the description must describe what the page is about. Search engines such as
        Google use that description to display in the results. Google will not show
        multiple pages with the same title and/or description on the page. That is a big
        reason why they need to be different.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Here is the &lt;title&gt; &amp; &lt;meta name="description"&gt; tag from a website
        I redesigned. This is the old title and description</p>
    <p><img src="//rborcherds.github.io/wdd130-instructor/announcements/images/dev-tools-title-desc.png"
            alt="dev tools image" /></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Here is the Google Search Results from the old title and description. You will
        notice that the description above is the exact same in the image below with the
        description and the text from the &lt;title&gt; tag.</p>
    <p><img src="//rborcherds.github.io/wdd130-instructor/announcements/images/serp-results.png"
            alt="SERP image" /></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>One of the big issues with this Contact Us page is that you will be embedding a
        Google Map into this page, and you must remove the inline CSS and put it into the
        CSS file. If you do not do this, you will miss points.</p>
