    <h2>Welcome to Week 5</h2>
    <p>This week you will read a talk from Elder Uchtdorf.&nbsp; This is an article to help you
        think about sharing the gospel online. You will have a few questions to answer</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>You will then be learning about the <strong><span style="color: #ba372a;">HTML table
                element</span></strong>. This table tag is one that used to be used for all web page
        layouts in the 1994 to 1997 time of the web. It was the only way to get half decent looking
        page layouts. Back then there were very few graphics being used in the HTML.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>You will then learn about creating <strong><span style="color: #ba372a;">HTML
                forms</span></strong>. Forms are used anytime you have to get input from the user.
        Every website has at least 1 form on the site. A simple login page, registration page,
        sign-up for a newsletter, contact us page are all example of the use of the form tag.</p>
    <p>You will then <span style="color: #ba372a;"><strong>learn about styling the
                forms</strong></span>. Styling forms is very important. You will learn about the
        styling for input layouts. In future classes you will also learn to style display forms. The
        way you style the is different.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h3><span style="color: #0d087e;"><strong>You will be creating 2 web pages with a form in
                them.</strong></span></h3>
    <p><span style="color: #ba372a;"><strong>The first is a quiz form</strong></span>. This is a
        very basic way that you can create questions and input for a quiz. You will not be
        processing the quiz in this class as that is for a future class once you have learned
        JavaScript as well.</p>
    <p><span style="color: #ba372a;"><strong>The second will be the Contact Us page for the Rafting
                Site</strong></span>. Make sure to pay close attention to how this is done. You copy
        part of the HTML from the About Us page and then you edit just 2 items from that and the
        page layout will have the same header and footer.</p>
    <p>You copy from line 1 of the html to the &lt;main&gt; tag and then from the &lt;/main&gt; to
        the &lt;html&gt; tag at the very end. You can copy the entire page and then just delete the
        content inside the main tag. You then edit the title and meta description tags in the
        &lt;head&lt; area. Remember that the title is not allowed to be the same on any page of a
        website and the description must describe what the page is about. Search engines such as
        Google use that description to display in the results. Google will not show multiple pages
        with the same title and/or description on the page. That is a big reason why they need to be
        different.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Here is the &lt;title&gt; &amp; &lt;meta name="description"&gt; tag from a website I
        redesigned. This is the old title and description </p>
    <p><img src="//borcherds-ralph.github.io/wdd130/announcements/images/dev-tools-title-desc.png"
            alt="dev tools image"></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Here is the Google Search Results from the old title and description. You will notice that
        the description above is the exact same as the test below the text from the &lt;title&gt;
        tag.</p>
    <p><img src="//borcherds-ralph.github.io/wdd130/announcements/images/serp-results.png"
            alt="SERP image"></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>I will be changing the text in both the title and description for when we go live with the
        new site.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>One of the big issues with this Contact Us page is that you will be embedding a Google Map
        into this page and you must remove the inline CSS and put it into the CSS file.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
