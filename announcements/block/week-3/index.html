    <h2>This is a big week</h2>
    <p>First, after this week you will no longer be able to submit work from Week 1
        without my approval. </p>
    <p>Second. This week you get to fill out a survey about your instructor. A few things
        to keep in mind.</p>
    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
        <li>I did not write the course material. If you have issue with the course content
            please make not of it for the feedback in week 6 about the course.</li>
        <li>You will be asked questions that may not apply to me directly, such as
            grading. Because of the format of this course, some of the questions apply but
            do not apply at the same time. Be honest on those</li>
    </ol>
    <p><span style="color: #ba372a;"><strong>Third: Last day to drop this course is May 7,
                2024.</strong></span></p>

    <h2>Now for what to expect this week.</h2>
    <p><strong>You will be learning how to make code comments</strong>. Commenting your
        code is a great way to remind yourself and other developers as to what is going on
        with the code and why you did certain things.</p>
    <p><strong>You will be learning about HTML References</strong>. This is how you access
        various things on the web and what the differences are for the various ways to
        write them. References are things like URL's, linking to specific parts of a page
        and how to find files on the server based upon where the file you are in is
        located. You will be using these all the time.</p>
    <p><strong>Next you will be learning about CSS selectors</strong>. Keep this in mind.
        What you learn about selectors in this class is just scratching the surface as to
        what you are able to do with selectors. Selectors is how you apply CSS to the
        various parts of your HTML. There are 4 basic types, Universal, Type, Class and
        ID.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>There is an aspect of the material that you will be taught on this topic that is
        not really used in the workplace. That is using ID names to apply CSS from a CSS
        file. ID names are generally used with JavaScript and not for normal CSS styling.
        You do have to know about it as you will see very few people doing this or
        JavaScript will be applying CSS to an element on a web page using the ID name.
        There will be some more information posted in the Random Help channel on this
        topic during the week.</p>
    <p>As a professional developer, the Type and Class are used all the time along with
        Combinators and separators, Selectors (pseudo-class), Type Selectors. ID is seldom
        used due to the limiting factor of the ID name.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>The next thing you will learn about is a CSS property called
            FLOAT</strong>. I personally have not used this in a web page since about
        2014. It is not something you should use all the time but for very specific
        reason. Most developers do not use it quite correctly and can make the page
        unstable to be used depending on what type of layout you are using.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>You will then learn about the CSS Position property</strong>. This is what
        allows you to place something in a spot on the page and it never moves, such as
        the navigation bar staying at the top of the browser screen so you can see it even
        while you are scrolling. Or the social media icons that hover over the on the left
        or right side of a web page all the time.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h2>Submission work</h2>
    <p>You will then work on some Home page enhancements using what you have learned</p>
    <p>You will then work on the wwr/about.html page. You will create this complete page.
        Just a reminder that you are NOT doing any CSS for the header, nav, footer in the
        About Us page. You will do that latter in the semester.</p>
    <p>Remember to review the Rubric on the Submission page before you submit to make sure
        you have accomplished everything on there. The Graders use the Rubric only for
        grading.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Your folder and file structure must look like this with the HTML and CSS filenames
        and folder names must match what is in this image.. You will not have the .vscode
        folder unless you have made settings changes. You do not need that folder. It is
        highlighted in blue.</p>
    <p><img src="//rborcherds.github.io/wdd130-instructor/announcements/images/vscode-week3-block-folder-files.png"
            alt="week 3 folder structure"></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The images folder in the wwr folder does not have all the images. You will have
        social media icons and other images. Those are your choice as to what those
        filenames are.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </p>
