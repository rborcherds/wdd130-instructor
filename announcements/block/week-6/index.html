    <h3><span style="color: #0d7b05;"><strong>What you will be doing for Week
                6.</strong></span></h3>
    <p>You have to submit the final 2 pages of your rafting website.</p>
    <p>You will study the <strong>Web Developer Roadmap</strong> and the <strong>Web
            Designer Roadmap </strong>and learn what it takes to do both jobs. You will
        also learn about interview questions for the Web Designer</p>
    <p>The font-end roadmap has a lot of information on it. This is very subjective and
        personal choice. It does give a great overview of most of the optional languages,
        skills etc. that you will need to learn to be successful as a web front-end
        developer.</p>
    <p>The Web Designer has a section about building your portfolio to showcase your work.
    </p>
    <p>You will do some research on potential jobs that you will be able to do including
        how to find an internship and post about it in the General Channel in Teams.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The rest of week 6 will be spent on building the last 2 pages of your website. You
        will build the trips page and the home page.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h3><span style="color: #780872;"><strong>Spiritual Thought/Question</strong></span>
