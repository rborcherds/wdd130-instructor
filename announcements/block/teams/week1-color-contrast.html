    <p> A lot of new developers use colors that they think look good to them, but in reality, they
        do not look good to everyone. </p>
    <p> There must be a good contrast between the text and background colors. One of the sites I use
        is: <a href="https://wave.webaim.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
            https://wave.webaim.org/ </a>
    </p>
    <p> At the top of the page there is an input field where you put the URL for the page you want
        to check. Here is a screenshot of the top of the page. </p>

    <p> Pay attention to any color contrast errors. You click on the red square and it will
        highlight the text in question and let you adjust colors to show you what is good color
        contrast. </p>
    <p> The only way you learn these things is with practice and playing with them. This is a great
        tool to teach you about color contrast. </p>
    <p>here is a great article on color contrast: <a
