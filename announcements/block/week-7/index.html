    <h2><span style="color: #050b77;"><strong>You have made it to the end of the
                class.</strong></span>
    </h2>
    <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Class officially ends on June 6, and the last day to submit
            assignments is June 6 @ 11:59 PM MDT. The course will auto lock on this day, and you
            will not be allowed to submit any more. This is set by the school, not me.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">If you have any personal questions or personal issues, please
            make sure to send me an e-mail.</span></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Questions about the course and the course material need to be
            posted in Microsoft Teams Help Channel. I do respond to those as quickly as I
            can.</span>

    <h3><span style="color: #d70505;"><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Week 6
                    Work</span></strong></span></h3>
    <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I did notice not a lot of you posted your research about the
            jobs you found in the General Channel. Keep in mind that other courses have this type of
            thing as mandatory and part of the grade. If you have never logged into Teams or do not
            look at it every day, you must start to do that. </span></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h3><span style="color: #d70505;"><strong>Microsoft Teams</strong></span></h3>
    <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I posted a lot of helpful hints and examples in the Random
            Help channel. Other instructors will be doing the same thing so get used to looking for
            that type of information. There are currently 16 courses in development that uses Teams
            for the class communications, and more are being added almost every semester.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Remember that Zoom is used by all classes, and you must have
            that installed on your computer. Some course will require you to hold zoom meetings with
            other students and record the meeting and submit the recording for grading. You must be
            using your school login for those meetings so that they can last longer than 45 minutes.
            Most of those meetings with other students will last 60 to 90 minutes.</span></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">You will have access to the Microsoft Teams Team WDD130-A6
            until Feb 2025 so you can access all the examples all the information in all the
            channels and save anything that you want to keep. Remember that there are quite a few
            examples I posted in there to help you with some of your styling.<br /></span></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Teams is also a way you can communicate with classmates using
            the chat feature. The chat feature is available all the time to all BYU-Idaho
            students.</span>
    </p>
    <h3><strong><span style="color: #d70505;">Final Grades</span></strong></h3>
    <p><span style="color: #ba372a; font-size: 14pt;">Just a reminder that if this is a required
            course for your certificate or degree, you must earn a C- or higher for it to count. If
            you do not get at least that grade, you will have to retake the course. Please reach out
            to your mentor for more information about this and guidance.</span></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Good luck with other courses and it has been a pleasure to be
            your instructor.</span></p>
