    <h2><span style="color: #ba372a;"><strong>What to Expect this week</strong></span>
    </h2>
    <h3><strong><span style="color: #0d087e;">Learning Activities</span></strong></h3>
    <p>This week you will be learning about two different layout methods for the Web.</p>
    <p>The first is Flex. Flex has been around for quite some time and most websites use
        this method for the layouts, but it does have some issues with the way you have to
        get things to layout in more complex layouts.</p>
    <p>The second and newer layout method is Grid. Grid is very powerful, and I use this
        for all my desktop web page layouts and then I use flex inside grid to do some
        minor tweaks. Neither one is the best and they work together.</p>
    <p>Take your time in doing the practices that you need to do. Grid can seem
        complicated and confusing. Make sure to ask questions about anything you do not
        understand. Grid is the layout method you will be using in this course with some
        flex.</p>
    <p>You will be doing some additional changes to your <strong>Homepage to finish it.
        </strong>I highly recommend you finish the homepage so that the site looks
        complete.</p>
    <p><strong>The Homepage</strong> changes will be done with grid. The example image you
        will see is using an image for Peru that is taller than wide. This is called a
        portrait layout. You may want to look for an image like that to use yourself. Most
        of you have very little text on that page. Consider increasing the amount of text
        about you.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>One of the hardest things for web developers to get used to doing is talking about
        themselves and putting that information on the web. This is a very common
        practice, and it is one that potential employers do look for when you apply for a
        job. They do look you up on social media, GitHub if you have that on your
        resume/CV and LinkedIn.</p>
    <h3><span style="color: #0d087e;"><strong>Work to be submitted</strong></span></h3>
    <p>You will be updating the<strong> About Us</strong> page.</p>
    <p><strong>About Us</strong> page layout is where you will be using grid for the main
        layout. You will use Flex in the header for the nav bar.</p>
    <p>You will be learning about a new HTML tag called figure and figcaption. These are
        very useful tags and are used quite a bit in web development for a variety of
        things, not just images. Make sure to read the Figure Element on MDN website to
        understand the usefulness of this tag. I do use this on almost every website I
        create because of how it is defined and supposed to be used.</p>
    <p>Keep in mind that the CSS you write for the header area will be used on all pages
        you will create for the wwr site. One CSS file for all pages on your site is a
        requirement.</p>
    <p>Please look in Teams in the Additional Materials channel for a post about keeping
        your CSS file orderly so you do not get duplicate rules. This is a big issue with
        CSS and very easy to do. I will be posting the way I setup my CSS files when I
        create them manually. The order of CSS file rules does matter some of the times,
        and you will learn about the order in more detail as you progress through the web
        development classes.</p>
