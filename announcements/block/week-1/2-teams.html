        <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Most of my help will be given in Microsoft
                        Teams. There is not place in Canvas for me to post helps that are
                        not announcements. I have already posted quite a few helps in
                        Microsoft Teams in the Help Channel.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Most of you probably have the Microsoft Teams
                        app on your computer but it will not work with logging into the
                        school system. When you launch the app and you see the button that
                        is in this screenshot, you must click it and install the New Teams
                        application to be able to log into the school account. If you are
                        running a version of Windows previous to Windows 10, you will not
                        be able to upgrade to the new Teams application. If you run into
                        this issue you will have to use the Web Based interface buy going
                        through Outlook to load it as described below.</span>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">To login access your BYU-Pathway email.</span>
        </p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Once in your e-mail you need to click the chat
                        icon. This is found in the top right of the Outlook screen.</span>
        </p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">

                                alt="chat icon"></span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Once in teams, click on your image/initial in
                        the top right corner.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">
                        <img src="//rborcherds.github.io/wdd130-instructor/announcements/images/chat-account-1.png"
                                alt="account icon"></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Then click on your name and e-mail address that
                        shows.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">
                        <img src="//rborcherds.github.io/wdd130-instructor/announcements/images/account-info.png"
                                alt="click to account details"></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">This will bring up your information. The Chat
                        e-mail is the e-mail address you can use to log into the Desktop
                        app and/or the cell phone app for Microsoft teams if the BYU-Idaho
                        email address does not work and not have to have it running in the
                        browser.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">As you will see the chat e-mail, for me is my
                        BYU-Idaho e-mail address from when I first attended in 1987. That
                        e-mail address is still active. I actually have 3 e-mail accounts
                        I can receive e-mails with at BYU-Idaho.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">You should be able to use both e-mail addresses
                        but there is a disconnect with BYU Pathway Worldwide students
                        right now that is being worked on. Try your e-mail address in the
                        image below first, if that does not work then use the chat e-mail
                        address. One of them should bring up the normal login page you use
                        to access the course work.</span></p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Once you know what your e-mail address is for
                        the Chat you can just go directly to</span></p>
