  <h2>Academic Honesty as it relates to the BYU-Idaho Honor Code</h2>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Some of you may have experience with HTML/CSS and
      other web technologies in the past. One of the things you have to be pay attention
      to is the Academic Honesty at BYU-Idaho. Because we have students from a lot of
      countries, I want to make sure you all understand what BYU-Idaho expects. Each
      culture has a slightly different interpretation of these Honesty Policies and in the
      work place it is different as well, but we are in a school setting.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">In this class and many of the development classes the
      most common forms are Fabrication, Cheating, and Other Misconduct from the
      definitions below. The use of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) falls into
      these definitions as well.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Please take the time to read the information on the
      BYU-Idaho website about GenAI (<a
        href="https://www.byui.edu/genai/academic-integrity/" target="_blank"
        rel="noopener">https://www.byui.edu/genai/academic-integrity/</a>). This is a new
      page that the school has added to help students and instructors understand the
      school
      policy on the use of GenAI.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong><span style="color: #ba372a;">The way you
          break the honor code in development classes is by using code you did not
          write</span>,</strong> by using libraries, templates or frameworks without the
      authorization from the instructor. Some libraries are required to complete work in
      other classes. In the work place, it is common place to use public libraries, as
      that is what they are for. For school work, they are not allowed. This is so that
      you learn how the code works by creating it yourself and in turn it helps you learn
      to debug code. At this time GenAI is only about 85% accurate in the code that it
      creates.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Personally, I have used a lot of libraries and tools
      for work and I have spent thousands of dollars to buy licenses as well. I have also
      been using GenAI for the last few years in various aspects of my professional work.
      These are tools to be used only after you understand what you are trying to
      accomplish and know how to code in the specified language.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Dishonesty may get you good grades but at what
      cost?</span></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2><strong><span style="color: #080a89;">Academic Dishonesty
        Definitions</span></strong></h2>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h3><span style="color: #ba372a;"><strong>Inadvertent Plagiarism</strong></span></h3>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Inadvertent plagiarism involves the inappropriate, but
      non-deliberate, use of another's words, ideas, or data without proper attribution.
      Although not a violation of the Honor Code, it is a form of academic misconduct for
      which an instructor can impose appropriate academic sanctions.</span></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h3><span style="color: #ba372a;"><strong>Plagiarism</strong></span></h3>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Intentional plagiarism is the deliberate act of
      representing the words, ideas, or data of another person or the use of AI as your
      own without providing proper attribution on the original author through quotation,
      reference, or footnote.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Plagiarism is probably the most well-known element of
      academic dishonesty.</span><span
      style="font-size: 14pt; color: var(--ic-brand-font-color-dark);">This includes the
      use of artificial intelligence technologies such as ChatGPT or using HTML, CSS, or
      JavaScript you did not personally write or are not given permission to use them and
      passing it off as your own.</span></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h3><span style="color: #ba372a;"><strong>Fabrication or Falsification</strong></span>
  </h3>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Fabrication or falsification occurs when a student
      invents or distorts the origin or content of information used as authority. Examples
      include:</span></p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Citing a source that does not exist</span></p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Citing information from a source that is not
          included in the source for which credit is given</span></p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Citing a source for a secondary proposition that
          it does not support</span></p>
    </li>
    <li><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Using code from another site without giving source
        credit to the original author.</span></li>
  </ul>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h3><span style="color: #ba372a;"><strong>Cheating</strong></span></h3>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">A student cheats when he or she attempts to give the
      appearance of a level of knowledge or skill that has not been obtained. Examples
      include:</span></p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Using unauthorized materials during an examination
          or while completing an assignment, this includes artificial intelligence
          technologies such as ChatGPT</span></p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Collaborating on an examination or assignment
          without authorization</span></p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Taking an examination or completing an assignment
          for another, or permitting another to take an examination or to complete an
          assignment that is not his or her own</span></p>
    </li>
    <li><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Using code you did not write to speed up
        development</span></li>
    <li><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Using a library without permission</span></li>
    <li><span style="font-size: 14pt;">using a Framework without permission</span></li>
    <li><span style="font-size: 14pt;">using GenAI without permission</span></li>
  </ul>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h3><span style="color: #ba372a;"><strong>Other Misconduct</strong></span></h3>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Other academic misconduct includes other academically
      dishonest, deceitful, or inappropriate acts which are intentionally committed.
      Examples include:</span></p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Obtaining or providing to another a test or
          answers</span></p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Submitting the same work for more than one class
          without disclosure and approval. There are many classes you may take where you
          may work on your resume/CV. If you have worked on it in one class and you want
          to use it in another course, your instructor needs to know that is where you are
          starting from and not creating it from scratch. Your instructor will give you
          guidance as to what to do.</span></p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Getting equal credit on group assignments when
          equal work was not done</span></p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Using content from a previous/other class or work
          in your current class.</span></p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Using artificial intelligence technologies to help
          or do your work as a student. The list of AI tools is too long to list all of
          them. Just know that you are not allowed to use them for anything that you
          submit for grading. There are over 3000 GenAI tools. Some estimates put that
          number well over 5000 tools.</span></p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h3><span style="color: #080a89;"><strong>Other questions and Answers I get
        often.</strong></span></h3>
  <p>I get this question all the time: <span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Are
        Libraries and Frameworks allowed in this class: </strong><span
        style="font-size: 18.6667px;"><strong>Answer is NO.</strong></span></span></p>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Do not use CSS frameworks in part or
        full</strong>. Students have tried to use individual rules from Bootstrap,
      Foundations, and Material CSS in my class. Do not do it, I have been using these
      myself in my profession so I recognize them very quickly.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I will allow you to use icons from Hero Icons ( <a
        href="https://heroicons.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
        https://heroicons.com </a> ) and Box Icons ( <a href="https://boxicons.com"
        target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://boxicons.com</a> ) for icons to be used in
      your rafting website. You must copy the SVG code of the icons into your code or make
      them images you reference. You will not be permitted to use them as font icons. This
      means no Font-Awesome allowed either. Ask me how to do this if you do not
      know.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>JavaScript is not allowed in this
        course.</strong> This is an introduction the HTML and CSS. Very basic and you need
      to keep it simple.</span></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">If any of you have questions about this please let me
      know.</span></p>
