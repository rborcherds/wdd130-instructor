        <h2><strong><span style="color: #040e5a;">Learning Activities</span></strong></h2>
        <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">This week we will be doing the following
                        learning activities. After you do the learning activities you will
                        then take a quiz on what you have learned. You are allowed to
                        retake the quiz a maximum of 3 times and the latest score is what
                        will be recorded.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">You will be learning about the common and
                        semantic HTML elements. You must use these in this course. You
                        will learn about the default layout called block and also inline
                        elements. These have been part of the HTML standard since 1994
                        standards.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">You will then learn about CSS and how to link a
                        CSS file to your HTML file. You will then learn about CSS values,
                        units of measurements and the box model. Box model is the default
                        CSS layout format.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">You will then learn how to troubleshoot the
                        validation errors. Validation is something you must do before you
                        submit any of your assignments in this course.</span></p>
        <h2><strong><span style="color: #040e5a;">Assignments</span></strong></h2>
        <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">You will be working on your homepage
                        enhancements this week. The rubric at the bottom of the page is
                        what will be graded and looked at by the graders. As long as you
                        do all those items you should get a good grade. One of the things
                        students' loose points on is not validating all their code and
                        fixing those errors that come up during the validation
                        process.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h2><span style="color: #040e5a;"><strong>Spiritual Thought/Question for the
                                Week</strong></span></h2>
        <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Take a scripture do want to learn more
                        about.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Go to the Citation Index website that BYU Provo
                        maintains at <a href="https://scriptures.byu.edu/" target="_blank"
                                rel="noopener">https://scriptures.byu.edu</a></span></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">This site is split into 3 sections. The left
                        side is all the scriptures showing the King James Version and the
                        Joseph Smith Translation of the Old and New Testament along with
                        the Book of Mormon, Doctrine &amp; Covenants and the Pearl of
                        Great Price. The middle section is where the text of the talks I
                        am asking you to lookup will be displayed. When you first open the
                        website this part of the web page gives you important information.
                        The right side is the citation index where you will lookup the
                        scripture you want to learn more about. There is a Spanish version
                        at <a href="https://escrituras.byu.edu" target="_blank"
                                rel="noopener">https://escrituras.byu.edu</a>.<br /></span>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <ul>
                <li><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Using the navigation on the right site
                                of the web page, find the scripture you want to learn more
                                about and click on it. Some versus will be in multiple
                                sections as part of a set of versus or an individual
                                one.</span></li>
                <li><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Select a talk that is being displayed
                                and read the section of the talk where that scripture is
                                referenced. You many need to read one or two paragraphs
                                before and/or after to get the full meaning.</span></li>
        </ul>
        <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><span style="color: #ba372a;"><strong>If you
                                        feel so inclined, post what you learned about the
                                        scripture you looked up and what you learned in
                                        Microsoft Teams Spiritual Challenge

        <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">This is a great activity to do as a Family Home
                        Evening lesson if you have older children or just adults as in an
                        YSA Ward.</span></p>
