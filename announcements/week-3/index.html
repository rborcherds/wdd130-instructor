      HTML elements. You must use these in this course. </span></p>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">You will then learn about the default layout called
      block and also inline elements. These have been part of the HTML standard since 1994
      standards.</span></p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2><span style="color: #040e5a;"><strong>Code Along Activity</strong></span></h2>
  <p>This weeks code along activity you will learn how to link to a CSS file. You are not
    allowed to use CSS code directly in the HTML files. You must use a CSS file that you
    link too to be HTML5 compliant. The Video for this will be posted on Wednesday
    September 10 in Microsoft Teams.</p>
  <h2><strong><span style="color: #040e5a;">Assignments</span></strong></h2>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">You will be working on your About Us page for the

      tool. So make sure to run that before submitting your assignment to make sure all
      items are addressed.</span></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2><span style="color: #040e5a;"><strong>Spiritual Thought/Question for the
        Week</strong></span></h2>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Take a scripture do want to learn more about.</span>
  </p>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Go to the Citation Index website that BYU Provo
      maintains at <a href="https://scriptures.byu.edu/" target="_blank"
        rel="noopener">https://scriptures.byu.edu</a></span></p>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">This site is split into 3 sections. The left side is
      all the scriptures showing the King James Version and the Joseph Smith Translation
      of the Old and New Testament along with the Book of Mormon, Doctrine &amp; Covenants
      and the Pearl of Great Price. The middle section is where the text of the talks I am
      asking you to lookup will be displayed. When you first open the website this part of
      the web page gives you important information. The right side is the citation index
      where you will lookup the scripture you want to learn more about. There is a Spanish
      version at <a href="https://escrituras.byu.edu" target="_blank"
        rel="noopener">https://escrituras.byu.edu</a>.<br /></span></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <ul>
    <li><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Using the navigation on the right site of the web
        page, find the scripture you want to learn more about and click on it. Some versus
        will be in multiple sections as part of a set of versus or an individual
        one.</span></li>
    <li><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Select a talk that is being displayed and read the
        section of the talk where that scripture is referenced. You many need to read one
        or two paragraphs before and/or after to get the full meaning.</span></li>
  </ul>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><span style="color: #ba372a;"><strong>If you feel so
          inclined, post what you learned about the scripture you looked up and what you
          learned in Microsoft Teams Spiritual Challenge
          channel</strong></span><br /></span></p>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">This is a great activity to do as a Family Home
      Evening lesson if you have older children or just adults as in an YSA Ward.</span>
