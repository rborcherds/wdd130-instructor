    <h2>This is a big week</h2>
    <p>First, after this week you will no longer be able to submit work from Week 1 without my
        approval. </p>
    <p>Second. This week you get to fill out a survey about your instructor. A few things to keep in
        mind.</p>
    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
        <li>I did not write the course material. If you have issue with the course content please
            make not of it for the feedback in week 6 about the course.</li>
        <li>You will be asked questions that may not apply to me directly, such as grading. Because
            of the format of this course, some of the questions apply but do not apply at the same
            time. Be honest on those</li>
    </ol>
    <p><span style="color: #ba372a;"><strong>Third: Last day to drop this course is May 7,
                2024.</strong></span></p>
    <h3><span><strong>Tutoring Services</strong></span></h3>
    <p><span>There are&nbsp;<strong>free&nbsp;</strong>tutoring resources available in this
            class!&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p dir="ltr"><span>Tutors are students or former students who have experience in this course.
            They are excited to help you do well! Tutoring will help you succeed. There are two
            types of tutor offerings:</span></p>
    <p dir="ltr"><span><strong>Group Study Sessions</strong>&nbsp;are led by a tutor and all
            students are welcome. Come with questions on this week&rsquo;s assignments or just come
            to learn from other students&rsquo; questions. To see the upcoming group study sessions
            or sign up to receive reminders, please visit&nbsp;<a

    <p dir="ltr"><span><strong>Personal Study Sessions</strong>&nbsp;with a tutor are helpful if you
            are finding the course or a topic difficult. The tutor can meet with you personally for
            a 30 minute session. You need to schedule Personal Study Sessions at least 12 hours in
            advance. To schedule a Personal Study Session with a tutor, please visit&nbsp;<a

    <p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p>
    <p dir="ltr"><span>Keep in mind that asking for help is not a sign of weakness but one of
            strength and it is one of the fastest ways to learn new things. It is also a great habit
            to get into for when you are working with a team. You all have to learn something, and
            no-one has all the answers. It helps you get the work done faster.</span></p>
    <p dir="ltr"><span>All online tutoring resources are&nbsp;<strong>free&nbsp;</strong>and open

    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h2>Now for what to expect this week.</h2>
    <p><strong>You will be learning how to make code comments</strong>. Commenting your code is a
        great way to remind yourself and other developers as to what is going on with the code and
        why you did certain things.</p>
    <p><strong>You will be learning about HTML References</strong>. This is how you access various
        things on the web and what the differences are for the various ways to write them.
        References are things like URL's, linking to specific parts of a page and how to find files
        on the server based upon where the file you are in is located. You will be using these all
        the time.</p>
    <p><strong>Next you will be learning about CSS selectors</strong>. Keep this in mind. What you
        learn about selectors in this class is just scratching the surface as to what you are able
        to do with selectors. Selectors is how you apply CSS to the various parts of your HTML.
        There are 4 basic types, Universal, Type, Class and ID.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>There is an aspect of the material that you will be taught on this topic that is not really
        used in the workplace. That is using ID names to apply CSS from a CSS file. ID names are
        generally used with JavaScript and not for normal CSS styling. You do have to know about it
        as you will see very few people doing this or JavaScript will be applying CSS to an element
        on a web page using the ID name. There will be some more information posted in the Random
        Help channel on this topic during the week.</p>
    <p>As a professional developer, the Type and Class are used all the time along with Combinators
        and separators, Selectors (pseudo-class), Type Selectors. ID is seldom used due to the
        limiting factor of the ID name.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>The next thing you will learn about is a CSS property called FLOAT</strong>. I
        personally have not used this in a web page since about 2014. It is not something you should
        use all the time but for very specific reason. Most developers do not use it quite correctly
        and can make the page unstable if not done correctly. There are also times when this will
        not be allowed to be used depending on what type of layout you are using.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>You will then learn about the CSS Position property</strong>. This is what allows you
        to place something in a spot on the page and it never moves, such as the navigation bar
        staying at the top of the browser screen so you can see it even while you are scrolling. Or
        the social media icons that hover over the on the left or right side of a web page all the
        time.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h2>Submission work</h2>
    <p>You will then work on some Home page enhancements using what you have learned</p>
    <p>You will then work on the wwr/about.html page. You will create this complete page. Just a
        reminder that you are NOT doing any CSS for the header, nav, footer in the About Us page.
        You will do that latter in the semester.</p>
    <p>Remember to review the Rubric on the Submission page before you submit to make sure you have
        accomplished everything on there. The Graders use the Rubric only for grading.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Your folder and file structure must look like this with the HTML and CSS filenames and folder
        names must match what is in this image.. You will not have the .vscode folder unless you
        have made settings changes. You do not need that folder. It is highlighted in blue.</p>
    <p><img src="https://borcherds-ralph.github.io/anouncements/images/vscode-week3-folder-files.png"
            alt="week 3 folder structure"></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The images folder in the wwr folder does not have all the images. You will have social media
        icons and other images. Those are your choice as to what those filenames are.&nbsp;&nbsp;
