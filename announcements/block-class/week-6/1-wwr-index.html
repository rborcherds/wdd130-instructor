    <p>YES, YOU WILL HAVE 2 INDEX.HTML FILES</p>
    <p>One will be in the wdd130 folder</p>
    <p>The other will be in the wwr folder.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>This image shows the folder and file structure for most of what you should have in this
        class. I do not show the image folders because those filenames will be different.</p>
    <p>This is what it will look like in VSCode. You may not have the .vscode folder as that are for
        settings specific to this project. Some of you may not have the .gitignore file. I posted
        about that in week 2 in Microsoft Teams and why you should have that file.</p>
