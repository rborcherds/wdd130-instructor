                        style="color: #050b77;">The Week 7 Final Project is due on Saturday, June
                        1,</span> with last day to submit late work Wednesday, June
                    6.</strong></span></span>
    </p>
    <p>Nothing can be submitted after this date. There are no exceptions to this.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h3><span style="color: #0d7b05;"><strong>What you will be doing for Week 6 &amp; 7 in the same
                week</strong></span></h3>
    <p>There is nothing to submit technically for week 6. You do have some learning activities</p>
    <p>You will study the Web Developer Roadmap and the Web Designer Roadmap and learn what it takes
        to do both jobs. You will also learn about interview questions for the Web Designer</p>
    <p>The font-end roadmap has a lot of information on it. This is very subjective and personal
        choice. It does give a great overview of all the optional languages, skills etc that you
        will need to learn to be successful as a web font-end developer.</p>
    <p>The Web Designer has a section about building your portfolio to showcase your work.</p>
    <p>You will do some research on potential jobs that you will be able to do including how to find
        an internship and post about it in the General Channel in Teams.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The rest of the week will be spent on building the last 2 pages of your website. You will
        build the trips page and the home page.</p>
    <p>Remember that the entire 4-page website due by June 1, with late submissions by June 6. The
        goal for the graders is to have everything graded by June 10, so that I will have time to
        review the final grades and get them submitted by 12:00 PM, June 12. MDT. The grades become
        official on June 13, when you will have access to them.</p>
    <p>The second block starts on June 10. If you do not have any class scheduled for then and would
        like to take more classes, you must go through the portal and request to register for the
        classes in the second block.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h3><span style="color: #780872;"><strong>Spiritual Thought/Question</strong></span></h3>
    <p>As we come to the end of this course, are there any spiritual questions that have come up
        doing the semester that you would like to find an answer to? Post the question and I will
        see if I can find an answer to give you direction as to where to look for the answers.</p>
