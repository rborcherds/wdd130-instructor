    <h3><strong><span style="color: #0d087e;">Learning

    </h3>
    <p>This week you will be learning about two different layout methods for the
        Web.</p>
    <p>The first is Flex. Flex has been around for quite sometime and most
        websites use this method for the layouts but it does have some issues
        with the way you have to get things to layout in more complex layouts.
    </p>
    <p>The second and newer layout method is Grid. Grid is very powerful and I
        use this for all my desktop web page layouts and then I use flex inside
        grid to do some minor tweaks. Neither one is the best and they work
        together.</p>
    <p>Take your time in doing the practices that you need to do. Grid can seem
        complicated and confusing. Make sure to ask questions about anything you
        do not understand. Grid is the layout method you will be using in this
        course with some flex.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h3><span style="color: #0d087e;"><strong>Work to be
                submitted</strong></span>
    </h3>
    <p>You will be doing some additional changes to your
        <strong>Homepage</strong> and updating the<strong> About Us</strong>
        page.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>The Homepage</strong> changes will be done with grid. The example
        image you will see is using an image for Peru that is taller than wide.
        This is called a portrait layout. You may want to look for an image like
        that to use yourself. Most of you have very little text on that page.
        Consider increasing the amount of text about you.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>One of the hardest things for web developers to get used to doing is
        talking about themselves and putting that information on the web. This
        is a very common practice and it is one that potential employers do look
        for when you apply for a job. They do look you up on social media,
        GitHub if you have that on your resume/CV and LinkedIn.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>About Us</strong> page layout is where you will be using grid for
        the main layout. You will use Flex in the header for the nav bar.</p>
    <p>You will be learning about a new HTML tag called figure and figcaption.
        These are very useful tags and are used quite a bit in web development
        for a variety of things, not just images. Make sure to read the Figure
        Element on MDN website to understand the usefulness of this tag. I do
        use this on almost every website I create because of how it is defined
        and supposed to be used.</p>
    <p>Keep in mind that the CSS you write for the header area will be used on
        all pages you will create for the wwr site. One CSS file for all pages
        on your site.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Please look in Teams in the Random Help channel for a post about keeping
        your CSS file orderly so you do not get duplicate rules. This is a big
        issue with CSS and very easy to do. I will be posting the way I setup my
        CSS files when I create them manually. The order of CSS file rules do
        matter and you will learn about the order in more detail as you progress
        through the web development classes.</p>
