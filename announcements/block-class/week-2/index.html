    <h2>Learning Activities</h2>
    <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">This week we will be be doing the following learning activities. After you do the learning activities you will then take a quiz on what you have learned. You are allowed to retake the quiz a maximum of 3 times and the latest score is what will be recorded.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">You will be learning about the common and semantic HTML elements. You must use these in this course. You will learn about the default layout called block and also inline elements. These have been part of the HTML standard since 1994 standards.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">You will then learn about CSS and how to link a CSS file to your HTML file. You will then learn about CSS values, units of measurements and the box model. Box model is the default CSS layout format.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">You will then learn how to troubleshoot the validation errors. Validation is something you must do before you submit any of your assignments in this course.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">You will then learn about what a website planning document is and why you must create one. I am going to be releasing a website I have created for a client at the start of February and I will share the Web Site Plan with you in a couple of weeks as well as the site once I have a few more things finished on it. That site plan is almost 300 pages long and is a great example of why you need to do these planning documents.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">You will then learn about wireframes. Wireframes are a mock-up of how the page will look. They can be as simple as being drawn on paper to using the real content and images to show where all the elements will go on each page.</span></p>

    <h2>Assignments</h2>
    <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">You will be working on your homepage enhancements this week. The rubric at the bottom of the page is what will be graded and looked at by the graders. As long as you do all those items you should get a good grade. One of the things students loose points on is not validating all their code and fixing those errors that come up during the validation process.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">You will then create the site plan for the project you will be working on. This is for a fictional company that does river rafting. There is a link in the instructions to a real website in this industry so you can see what this company will be doing. Everyone must do this project. The colors and some of the content will be unique to you along with the images you choose to use. Most of the text will be given to you to use.</span></p>

    <h2>Spiritual Thought/Question for the Week</h2>
    <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Take a scripture do want to learn more
            about.</span></p>
    <p>
        <span style="font-size: 14pt;">Go to the Citation Index website that BYU
            Provo maintains at <a href="https://scriptures.byu.edu/" target="_blank"
                rel="noopener">https://scriptures.byu.edu</a></span>
    </p>
    <p>
        <span style="font-size: 14pt;">This site is split into 3 sections. The left
            side is all the scriptures showing the King James Version and the Joseph
            Smith Translation of the Old and New Testament along with the Book of
            Mormon, Doctrine &amp; Covenants and the Pearl of Great Price. The
            middle section is where the text of the talks I am asking you to lookup
            will be displayed. When you first open the website this part of the web
            page gives you important information. The right side is the citation
            index where you will lookup the scripture you want to learn more about.
            There is a Spanish version at <a href="https://escrituras.byu.edu"
                target="_blank"
                rel="noopener">https://escrituras.byu.edu</a>.<br></span>
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <span style="font-size: 14pt;">Using the navigation on the right site of
                the web page, find the scripture you want to learn more about and
                click on it. Some versus will be in multiple sections as part of a
                set of versus or an individual one.</span>
        </li>
        <li>
            <span style="font-size: 14pt;">Select a talk that is being displayed and
                read the section of the talk where that scripture is referenced. You
                many need to read one or two paragraphs before and/or after to get
                the full meaning.</span>
        </li>
        <li>
            <span style="font-size: 14pt;">If you feel so inclined, post what you
                learned about the scripture you looked up and what you
                learned.<br></span>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        <span style="font-size: 14pt;">This is a great activity to do as a Family
            Home Evening lesson if you have older children or just adults as in a
            YSA Ward.</span>
