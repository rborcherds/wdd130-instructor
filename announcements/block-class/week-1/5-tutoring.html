    <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">There are&nbsp;<strong>free&nbsp;</strong>tutoring resources
            available in this class!&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Tutors are students or former students who have
            experience in this course. They are excited to help you do well! Tutoring will help you
            succeed. There are two types of tutor offerings:</span></p>
    <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Group Study Sessions</strong>&nbsp;are led
            by a tutor and all students are welcome. Come with questions on this week&rsquo;s
            assignments or just come to learn from other students&rsquo; questions. To see the
            upcoming group study sessions or sign up to receive reminders, please visit&nbsp;<a

                rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/3TVS3xX</a>.</span></p>
    <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Personal Study Sessions</strong>&nbsp;with a
            tutor are helpful if you are finding the course or a topic difficult. The tutor can meet
            with you personally for a 30 minute session. You need to schedule Personal Study
            Sessions at least 12 hours in advance. To schedule a Personal Study Session with a
            tutor, please visit&nbsp;<a class="ms-outlook-linkify" href="https://bit.ly/4aD2L25"
                target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://bit.ly/4aD2L25</a>.</span></p>

    <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Keep in mind that asking for help is not a sign of
            weakness but one of strength and it is one of the fastest ways to learn new things. It
            is also a great habit to get into for when you are working with a team. You all have to
            learn something, and no-one has all the answers. It helps you get the work done
            faster.</span></p>
    <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">All online tutoring resources
            are&nbsp;<strong>free&nbsp;</strong>and open to&nbsp;<strong>all&nbsp;</strong>students
            in this course!</span></p>
