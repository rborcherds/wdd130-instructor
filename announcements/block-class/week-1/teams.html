    <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Most of my help will be given in Microsoft
            Teams. There is not place in Canvas for me to post helps that are
            not announcements. I have already posted quite a few helps in
            Microsoft Teams in the Help Channel.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Most of you probably have the Microsoft
            Teams app on your computer but it will not work with the logging
            into the school system. When you launch the app and you see the
            button that is in this screenshot, you must click it and install the
            New Teams application to be able to log into the school account. If
            you are running a version of Windows previous to Windows 10, you
            will not be able to upgrade to the new Teams application. If you run
            into this issue you will have to use the Web Based interface but
            going through Outlook to load it as described below.</span></p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">To login access your BYU-Idaho email. See
            my earlier announcement on how to access that through the Pathway
            Portal.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Once in your e-mail you need to click the
            chat icon. This is found in the top left of the Outlook
            screen.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><img
                src="https://borcherds-ralph.github.io/wdd130/announcements/images/outlook-to-teams-chat-icon.png"
                alt="chat icon"></span></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Once in teams, click on your image/initial
            in the top right corner</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><img
                src="https://borcherds-ralph.github.io/wdd130/announcements/images/chat-account-1.png"
                alt="account icon"></span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Then click on your name and e-mail address
            that shows</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><img
                src="https://borcherds-ralph.github.io/wdd130/announcements/images/account-info.png"
                alt="click to account details"></span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">This will bring up your information. The
            Chat e-mail is the e-mail address you can use to log into the
            Desktop app and/or the cell phone app for Microsoft teams and not
            have to have it running in the browser.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">As you will see the chat e-mail, for me is
            my BYU-Idaho e-mail address from when I first attended in 1987. That
            e-mail address is still active. I actually have 3 e-mail accounts I
            can receive e-mails with at BYU-Idaho.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">You should be able to use both e-mail
            addresses but there is a disconnect with BYU Pathway Worldwide
            students right now that is being worked on. Try your e-mail address
            in the image below first, if that does not work then use the chat
            e-mail address. One of them should bring up the normal login page
            you use to access the course work.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><img
                src="https://borcherds-ralph.github.io/wdd130/announcements/images/chat-email.png"
                alt="get chat e-mail"></span></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">One you know what your e-mail address is
            for the Chat you can just go directly to</span></p>

            to login to Outlook and Teams without going through the BYU Pathway
            Portal.</span></p>
