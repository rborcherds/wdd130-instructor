    <h2>Using Zoom with BYU-Idaho credentials</h2>
    <p>The first thing you need to do is to download Zoom and install it on your
        computer</p>
    <p>The download location is <a href="https://zoom.us/download"
            target="_blank">https://zoom.us/download</a></p>
    <p>Now that Zoom is installed, run it. You will get a screen that looks
        something like this:</p>
    <img src="https://borcherds-ralph.github.io/wdd130/announcements/images/zoom-sso-link.png" alt="Zoom login screen">
    <p>click the SSO button at the bottom</p>
    <p>You will then get a screen that looks like this. Make sure it says byui
        in the text box and click continue</p>
    <img src="https://borcherds-ralph.github.io/wdd130/announcements/images/zoom-sso-domain.png" alt="SSO Domain info page">
    <p>This will then open your default web browser for you to login to Zoom</p>
    <p>At this point the login page in the browser will look like your normal
        login page for access to teh school resources. Click the BYU-Pathway
        Worldwide Login if you are a BYU-Pathway student or login using yoru
        BYU-Idaho credentials if you are on on-campus or non Pathway online
        student.</p>
    <img src="https://borcherds-ralph.github.io/wdd130/announcements/images/zoom-sso-login-page.png" alt="Zoom BYUI login page">
    <p>You will get this next screen once you are successfully logged into zoom.
        If you get a message to open an application, it is recommended that you
        click the ALWAYS option, then click teh blue Launch Zoom button.</p>

        alt="Zoom launch application page">
    <p>Once you have successfully logged into Zoom on the web, you will be taken
        back to the Zoom application. There are a lot of things that you can
        only do via the web interface with Zoom. Not all information is in the
        application.</p>
    <p>You will want to take a few minutes to familiarize yourself with the zoom
        application and the option in the web interface. You will have some
        classes that will require you to record presentation using zoom and
        submit that as your homework.</p>
