        <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I know some of you will feel
                overwhelmed by all the new terminology that you will be
                learning. Do not get discouraged, it will come with some time
                and practice. Most students start to understand this faster than
                others.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Make sure to ask questions and for
                clarification of things you do not understand. I am happy to
                clarify anything until you understand it.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">There are a lot of international
                students attending BYU-Idaho. I know a lot of you will think
                that words are spelled incorrectly. For the USA, they are
                spelled correctly.&nbsp;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Here are some examples:</span></p>

        <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>FYI: </strong>If you find
                something that does not make sense make sure to ask for
                clarifications. The instructions get updated on a regular basis
                and may not be worded in a way that you will understand
                them.</span></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h2><strong><span style="color: #050b77;">Your
                    responsibilities</span></strong>
        </h2>
        <p><span style="color: #d70505;">You are responsible to read <strong>all
                    Announcements</strong>. Announcements will clarify the
                instructions</span>. I have a lot of helps and suggestion in the
            announcements and in the weekly Discussion Boards. I also give
            instructions in some weeks on how to make it easier to submit your
            homework as the instructions are not clear on how to do that.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p><span style="color: #d70505;">You must check your feedback on each
                graded assignment to see how to improve your work</span>. Each
            weeks submissions builds on the previous week. This means that if
            you do not fix something, it will affect future weeks. How to be
            Successful in Online Courses reading assignemtn gives you some info
            on how to do this.</p>
        <p>You <strong>MUST</strong> follow the instructions word for word. If
            you skim them you will miss important information and struggle with
            the course material. <span style="color: #d70505;">Web development
                is a very detail oriented profession</span>.</p>
        <p>Procrastination is an enemy in this class. Do not wait till the due
            date to do the homework. You will have due dates on Wednesday and
            Saturday in this course. You may not get it done on time.</p>
        <h2>Your first assignment</h2>
        <h3>Your first assignment will be to install software and setup the
            software.</h3>
        <p>You will download and install Visual Studio Code (VSCode). The
            instructions are given for Windows and MAC in these direction. If
            you run Linux please contact me if you have issues. I run Linux as
            my OS every day.</p>
        <p>One of the things you will install is an extension called Live
            Server. I will warn you know that if you install any of the AI
            extensions, I will make you remove them. The US of AI in school work
            is prohibited unless the instructor gives you specific permission ot
            use AI. The other thing is that the Coding AI extension all require
            you to signup with them and pay a monthly fee. Wait until you are
            making money before paying for those. They can get very costly.</p>
        <p>You will then install a web browser extension call Web Developer. The
            instructions are for Google Chrome only. This extension will work in
            all Chromium browsers (Microsoft Edge, Brave, etc), Firefox and
            Opera. Let me know if you have issues installing this extension. You
            will use it multiple times each week. </p>
        <h3>GitHub Account</h3>
        <p>You must setup a GitHub account as all your coding assignments will
            be submitted using a URL from GitHub. Make sure to follow the
            instructions carefully.
        <p>
        <p style="font-weight: 700; font-size: 18pt; color: #f00">You must use
            lowercase on GitHub.</p>
        <p>Do not create your repository on GitHub. This will be done using
            VSCode when you push your first set of code to GitHub. If you do, it
            will require a zoom meeting with me to fix.</p>
        <h3>Installing Git</h3>
        <p>You must follow these instructions carefully. If you do not it will
            require a zoom meeting with me to fix.</p>
        <h3>Next is the Learning Activities</h3>
        <p>This activity will take you through a few activities to teach you
            about File and Folder naming. The web is case sensitive so this
            explains the best practices for that. You will then get an
            introduction to HTML and then you will learn about web images. This
            is one of the biggest reasons web pages are slow to load.</p>
        <h3>Building your Course Homepage</h2>
            <p>This is when you start to actually write your first HTML in this
                class.</p>
            <p>Follow the instructions explicity. The it says (lower case, no
                spaces) next to the line of instructions, you
                <strong>MUST</strong> do that. You must use the filenames that
                the instructions give you.</p>
            <p>During these steps you will create the GitHub repository from
                VSCode. You must make sure you select the correct options or
                these instructions will not work. You have to publish your site
                you will be creating in GitHub. The instructions have these
                steps. Make sure to follow them carefully.</p>
            <h3>Late Work and Grading</h3>
            <p>I am a web developer and as a professional web developer, late
                work is unacceptable, clients prefer early. This is a great
                habit to get into.</p>
            <p>With that said, this course is setup so that there will be
                certified graders doing all the grading. If you have a question
                about the grade, you must submit a question in the grade
                feedback area. They will address it with you directly. I will
                not be changing their grades. They go by the Rubric that is on
                every assignment that they grade.</p>
            <p>Resubmissions are on a permission basis only. That permission
                will come from me only.</p>
            <p>Because this course is only 7 weeks, you must get things in on
                time. Assignments from the first 3 weeks are only available for
                late submissions for 4 weeks after the due date. After that, the
                late submission are not accepted beyond the end of week 7.</p>
            <p>My job is to help you understand the material and help you fix
                any issues you have.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <h2><strong><span style="color: #050b77;">Error messages in
                    </span></strong><strong><span style="color: #050b77;">VSCode
                        or with Git commands</span></strong></h2>
            <p>I give you this info now because a lot of you will get errors
                messages.</p>
            <p>Take a screenshot of the error and send it to me using the Canvas
                e-mail system only. Do not send to my BYU-Idaho e-mail. Those
                doe not always go through and sometimes get flagged as Junk
                e-mail when coming from your personal e-mail accounts.</p>

            <h2><strong><span style="color: #081470;">Additional Helps for the
                        class</span></strong></h2>
            <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I highly recommend you install a
                    browser extension called FireShot. This extension allows you
                    to capture an entire web page as an image in JPG, PNG, or
                    Webp format.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">The Chrome extension (works in
                    Microsoft Edge) can be found by going here: &nbsp;<a

            <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">If you are going to be taking the
                    web development and design classes from BYU-Idaho, quite a
                    few of the classes will ask you to make screen shots of the
                    web pages you are creating. The FireShot extension will make
                    it so much easier to create them. Fireshot is free to use
                    the basic features.</span></p>

            <h2><span style="color: #081470;">Spiritual Thought/Question for the
                    Week</span>
            </h2>
            <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I want to share with you some
                    truths about learning. This is something that I learned
                    years ago and it has helped. There are a couple of
                    scriptures I want to point you too. The first thing you need
                    to understand is that all truth belongs to the doctrine of
                    the kingdom. President Brigham Young taught "If you can find
                    a truth in heaven, earth or hell, it belongs to our
                    doctrine. We believe it; it is ours; we claim it" (DBY, 2).
                    This does not mean just spiritual knowledge but secular
                    knowledge as well.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">The first scripture is found in
                    <strong>D&amp;C 88:77-79</strong>. In these versus we find
                    the commandment about gaining an education and how to teach
                    one-another.&nbsp;</span></p>
            <blockquote>
                <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">77 And I give unto you a
                        commandment that you shall teach one another the
                        doctrine of the kingdom.</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">78 Teach ye diligently and my
                        grace shall attend you, that you may be instructed more
                        perfectly in theory, in principle, in doctrine, in the
                        law of the gospel, in all things that pertain unto the
                        kingdom of God, that are expedient for you to
                        understand;</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">79 Of things both in heaven
                        and in the earth, and under the earth; things which have
                        been, things which are, things which must shortly come
                        to pass; things which are at home, things which are
                        abroad; the wars and the perplexities of the nations,
                        and the judgments which are on the land; and a knowledge
                        also of countries and of kingdoms</span></p>
            </blockquote>
            <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Verse 79 gives us a great list of
                    things to learn in our lifetime. Think of the terminology
                    used to day for each items in that list: "In the heavens"
                    for example are things like astronomy, space flight,
                    satellites, etc.</span>
            </p>
            <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Notice it does not say to pick one
                    or two things but to learn all. &nbsp;This is one of
                    BYU-Idaho's principles, teaching you to become a lifelong
                    learner.</span>
            </p>
            <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">The second scripture is found in
                    <strong>Alma 37:8</strong>. This is when Alma is explaining
                    to his son Helaman about the writing on the plates and what
                    his charge will be in keeping the record of his people.
                    Verse 8 gives us a very helpful piece of information about
                    how we can retain what we learn. I am bolding the part of
                    the scripture I will be focusing on.</span></p>
            <blockquote>
                <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">8 And now, it has hitherto
                        been wisdom in God that these things should be
                        preserved; for behold, <strong>they have enlarged the
                            memory of this people</strong>, yea, and convinced
                        many of the error of their ways, and brought them to the
                        knowledge of their God unto the salvation of their
                        souls.</span></p>
            </blockquote>
            <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">The word <strong>THEY</strong> is
                    referring to the scriptures that Alma has been talking
                    about. In other words, by studying the scriptures, you will
                    be blessed with a greater memory and be able to recall
                    things to your mind. I promise you, if you keep studying the
                    scriptures everyday along with your school work, you will be
                    able to remember more and do better in school. It will take
                    time to show your faithfulness to be able to get this
                    blessing.</span></p>
