  <h2><span style="color: #ba372a;"><strong>What to Expect this week</strong></span>
  </h2>
  <h3><strong><span style="color: #0d087e;">Learning Activities</span></strong></h3>
  <p>This week you will be learning about two different layout methods for the Web.</p>
  <p><strong>The first is Flex</strong>. Flex has been around for quite some time and
    most websites use this method for the layouts, but it does have some issues with
    the way you have to get things to layout in more complex layouts.</p>
  <p><strong>The second and newer layout method is Grid</strong>. Grid is very powerful,
    and I use this for all my desktop web page layouts and then I use flex inside grid
    to do some minor tweaks. Neither one is the best and they work together.</p>
  <p>Take your time in doing the practices that you need to do. Grid can seem
    complicated and confusing. Make sure to ask questions about anything you do not
    understand. Grid is the layout method you will be using in this course with some
    flex.</p>
  <p><strong>The third activity</strong> will walk you through the differences of Flex
    and Grid and the best times to use each one. As a professional developer, I use
    both in every web pages I create. Grid for the main layout and Flex for the finer
    positioning of items inside the grid.</p>
  <h2><strong><span style="color: #040e5a;">Code Along Activity</span></strong></h2>
  <p>You will be doing some additional changes to your <strong>Homepage to finish it.
    </strong>I highly recommend you finish the homepage so that the site looks
    complete.</p>
  <p><strong>The Homepage</strong> changes will be done with grid. The example image you
    will see is using an image for Peru that is taller than wide. This is called a
    portrait layout. You may want to look for an image like that to use yourself. Most
    of you have very little text on that page. Consider increasing the amount of text
    about you.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>One of the hardest things for web developers to get used to doing is talking about
    themselves and putting that information on the web. This is a very common
    practice, and it is one that potential employers do look for when you apply for a
    job. They do look you up on social media, GitHub if you have that on your
    resume/CV and LinkedIn.</p>
  <h3><span style="color: #0d087e;"><strong>Work to be submitted</strong></span></h3>
  <p>You will be updating the<strong> About Us</strong> page.</p>
  <p><strong>About Us</strong> page layout is where you will be using grid for the main
    layout. You will use Flex in the header for the nav bar.</p>
  <p>You will be learning about a new HTML tag called figure and figcaption. These are
    very useful tags and are used quite a bit in web development for a variety of
    things, not just images. Make sure to read the Figure Element on MDN website to
    understand the usefulness of this tag. I do use this on almost every website I
    create because of how it is defined and supposed to be used.</p>
  <p>Keep in mind that the CSS you write for the header and footer areas will be used on
    all pages you will create for the wwr site. One CSS file for all pages on your
    site is a requirement.</p>
  <p><strong>This week the grading will be done using both the Page Audit tool and the
      Rubric found at the bottom of the submission page.</strong></p>
  <p>Please look in Teams in the Additional Materials channel for a post about keeping
    your CSS file orderly so you do not get duplicate rules. This is a big issue with
    CSS and very easy to do. I will be posting the way I setup my CSS files when I
    create them manually. The order of CSS file rules does matter some of the times,
    and you will learn about the order in more detail as you progress through the web
    development classes.</p>
