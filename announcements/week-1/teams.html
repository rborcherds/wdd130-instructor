  <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Most of my help will be given in Microsoft
      Teams. There is not place in Canvas for me to post helps that are
      not announcements. I have already posted quite a few helps in
      Microsoft Teams in the General&nbsp; Channel and the FAQ -
      Additional Materials channel.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">There are 3 ways to access Teams. You have to
      log into Teams using your BYU Pathway email address. Let me know
      if you do not know what that is.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>The first is to go to this URL and login
        with your BYU Pathway email address.</strong> <a class="inline_disabled"
        href="https://teams.microsoft.com/v2/" target="_blank"
        rel="noopener">https://teams.microsoft.com/v2/</a></span>
  </p>
  <p><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">The second way is to use the Microsoft
        Education link on the left in
        Canvas:&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><img
        src="https://byupw.instructure.com/courses/28145/files/4247636/preview"
        alt="image.png"
        data-api-endpoint="https://byupw.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/28145/files/4247636"
        data-api-returntype="File" /></span></p>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Click the Sign In button</span></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Use your BYU Pathway email address</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Once you have signed in click the Teams
      button</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><img
        src="https://byupw.instructure.com/courses/28145/files/4247641/preview"
        alt="image.png"
        data-api-endpoint="https://byupw.instructure.com/api/v1/courses/28145/files/4247641"
        data-api-returntype="File" /></span></p>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">That will launch the Teams web interface like
      the first option</span></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>The third and the most complex option to
        setup initially</strong>. This works with both the mobile
      app and desktop apps.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">You must make sure that the Teams app you have
      installed is the most recent versions.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">When you click the login option, you must use
      your BYU Pathway email address to login.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">If you have issues with this let me&nbsp; know
      and I can do a zoom meeting with you to get it setup.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">If you are logging into Teams with multiple
      accounts, you will have multiple Teams icons running on your
      computer.</span></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Once you are logged into Teams, you will see the
      teams you are a member of on the left. Click on the team for this
      class to see the channels and posts.</span></p>
