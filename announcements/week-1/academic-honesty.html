  <h1>Academic Honesty as it relates to the school Honor Code</h1>
  <p>Some of you may have experience with HTML/CSS and other web technologies in the past.
    One of the things you have to be pay attention to is the Academic Honesty. Because we
    have students from a lot of countries, I want to make sure you all understand what
    BYU-Idaho expects. Each culture has a slightly different interpretation of these
    Honesty Policies and in the work place it is different as well, but we are in a school
    setting. </p>
  <p>This is taken directly from training about the various ways students can violate the
    Honor Code. In this class, and many of the development classes, the most common forms
    are Fabrication, Cheating, and Other Misconduct from the definitions below. </p>
  <p><strong>The way you cheat is by using code you did not write,</strong> using
    libraries, such as jQuery, and using templates or frameworks such as Bootstrap without
    authorization from the instructor to complete the work. Some libraries are required to
    complete work in other classes. The real world this is not an issue to use public
    libraries as that is what they are for. For school work, we want to make sure you know
    how the code works by having you create it from scratch. This does help you once you
    get into the real world to troubleshoot bugs. </p>

  <p>Dishonesty may get you good grades but at what cost? For a great reasoning about why
    you should not use AI while learning to code, I recommend you read this: <a

      You a Better Developer</a> </p>

  <h2>Academic Dishonesty Definitions</h2>

  <h3>Inadvertent Plagiarism</h3>
  <p>Inadvertent plagiarism involves the inappropriate, but non-deliberate, use of
    another's words, ideas, or data
    without proper attribution. Although not a violation of the Honor Code, it is a form
    of academic misconduct for which an instructor can impose appropriate academic
    sanctions. </p>
  <p>This type of plagiarism most often occurs when another student is helping your learn
    the code and you end up copying it. This is not allowed. When helping each other, you
    must remember that you cannot copy the HTML code and text directly for the entire
    page. It is normal for some parts to be the same but not everything.</p>

  <h3>Plagiarism</h3>
  <p>Intentional plagiarism is the deliberate act of representing the words, ideas, or
    data of another as one's own without providing proper attribution on the original
    author through quotation, reference, or footnote. </p>
  <p>Plagiarism is probably the most well-known element of academic dishonesty. This
    includes the use of artificial intelligence technologies such as ChatGPT, Copilot, etc
    or using HTML, CSS, or JavaScript you did not personally write and passing it off as
    your own.
  </p>

  <h3>Fabrication or Falsification</h3>
  <p>Fabrication or falsification occurs when a student invents or distorts the origin or
    content of information used as authority. Examples include: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>Citing a source that does not exist
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Citing information from a source that is not included in the source for which
        credit is given </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Citing a source for a secondary proposition that it does not support </p>
    </li>
    <li>Using code from another site without giving source credit to the original author.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Cheating</h3>
  <p>A student cheats when he or she attempts to
    give the appearance of a level of knowledge or skill that has not been
    obtained. Examples include: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>Using unauthorized materials during an examination or while completing an
        assignment, this includes artificial intelligence technologies such as ChatGPT
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Collaborating on an examination or assignment without authorization </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Taking an examination or completing an assignment for another, or permitting
        another to take an examination or to complete an assignment that is not his or her
        own </p>
    </li>
    <li>Using code you did not write to speed up
      development </li>
    <li>Using a library without permission
    </li>
    <li>using a Framework without permission
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Other Misconduct</h3>
  <p>Other academic misconduct includes other academically dishonest, deceitful, or
    inappropriate acts which are intentionally committed. Examples include: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>Obtaining or providing to another a test or answers </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Submitting the same work for more than one class without disclosure and approval.
        There are many classes you can take where you may work on your resume/CV. If you
        have worked on it in another course your instructor needs to know that is where
        you are starting from and not creating it from scratch. Your instructor will give
        you guidance as to what to do. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Getting equal credit on group assignments when equal work was not done </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Using content from a previous/other class in your current class. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Using artificial intelligence technologies to help or do your work as a student.
        The list of AI tools is too long to list all of them. Just know that you are not
        allowed to use them for anything that you submit for grading. </p>

    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Additional information about what is allowed</h2>
  <p>I get this question all the time: <strong>Are Libraries and Frameworks allowed in
      this class:</strong> <span class="answer">The short answer NO</span> </p>

  <p>Do not use CSS frameworks in part or full. Students have tried to use individual
    rules from Bootstrap, Foundations, and Material CSS in my class. Do not do it, I have
    been using these myself in my profession so I recognize them very quickly. Frameworks
    are also detected through the use of the Page Evaluation as they will make the total
    size of the pages too large for the requirements of schoolwork. You will get to use
    them in a future class.</p>
  <p>I will allow you to use icons from Hero Icons
    ( <a href="https://heroicons.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
      https://heroicons.com </a> ) and Box Icons ( <a href="https://boxicons.com"
      target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://boxicons.com</a> ) for icons to be used in
    your final project. You must copy the SVG code of the icons into your code or make
    them images you reference. You will not be permitted to use them as font icons. This
    means no Font Awesome allowed. Font Awesome does not pass CSS validation and you will
    loose points for that, so I do not allow it. </p>
  <p>There is not JavaScript allowed in this class.</p>
  <p>If any of you have questions about this please let me know. </p>
