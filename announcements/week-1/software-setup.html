  <h1>Software Setup</h1>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Here are some additional helps for software that you
      will be using.</span></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Zoom </strong>- I will be holding all my
      meetings using Zoom. You cannot use the Zoom Browser version as that limits the
      ability of how I can help you. </span><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">You must
      install the Zoom software: <a href="https://www.zoom.us/download#client_4meeting"
        target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.zoom.us/download#client_4meeting</a>
      You do not need to sign into zoom as you will be having meetings with your
      instructors that have the license.&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>MS Teams </strong>- Microsoft Teams is
      required for class communications.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I only give help in MS Teams for issues with the
      class. You can click on this link to open the MS Team for this class. You must log
      into Teams using your BYU Pathway email address and you must be using your BYU
      Pathway email address as your default and primary address in Canvas for the
      integration to work.</span> <a href="http://teams.microsoft.com/v2">Microsoft Teams
      Web Interface</a></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>VSCode</strong></span></p>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Make sure to <span
        style="color: #ba372a; font-weight: 700;">only install the extensions that are
        required for your classes</span>. The more extensions you install the slower
      VSCode
      will run and take longer to load. When I am doing zoom calls with you, I will
      remove any AI related extensions. They are not allowed as a student. You must do
      your own work. Refer to the Academic Honor Code for details on this. DO NOT
      activate copilot which is not allowed in any coding course as a student.</span>
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>GitHub</strong></span></p>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">If you already have a GitHub username, you must use
      that. GitHub only allows 1 account per e-mail address for user for personal use. You
      will be using the personal account setup.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><span style="color: #ba372a;">DO NOT use any GitHub
        username with BYU, BYUI, Pathway, or PW or any combination of them in your GitHub
        username.</span> This GitHub account is for you to use to showcase what you have
      learned as a developer, not just a student.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">You can use your Pathway e-mail address, but I
      recommend using your personal e-mail address and you can add your byupathway.edu
      address as a secondary e-mail address on your account. You will only have the
      byupathway.edu e-mail address as long as you are a student.</span></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Git</strong></span></p>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">This is different from GitHub. You must make sure you
      run all 3 commands in the instructions to set the global configurations before you
      start to do any coding. If you do not, it will require a zoom call with me to fix.
      If you will be sharing your computer with another student or user of Git/GitHub, you
      must let me know so I can give you the instructions on how to setup the computer for
      multiple users.</span></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Post any questions in MS Teams in the Help Request
      channel.</span></p>
