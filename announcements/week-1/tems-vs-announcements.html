  <h2><strong>Why use all three</strong></h2>
  <p>The course discussion is occurring in Microsoft Teams. All help and questions about
    the course are in Microsoft Teams.</p>
  <p>While Microsoft Teams will be the primary vehicle for course discussion and
    coordination, Canvas announcements and email have important roles as well.</p>
  <h3><span style="color: #0d087e;">Microsoft Teams</span></h3>
  <p>Microsoft Teams is the primary platform for all communication in this course. All
    course material help and additional materials are only posted in Microsoft Teams.
    There will be a lot of information that will only be posted in Microsoft Teams. You
    must check this multiple times a week.</p>
  <p>Teams chat feature is for some private communication but most private communication
    must be done via email using the Canvas Inbox. If you ask questions for help in Chat,
    you will be asked to post the question in the Help Request Channel in Teams.</p>

    <li>Participation in the <strong>Microsoft Teams discussions are not optional
      </strong>and will be the primary communication method used in the course.</li>

  <h3><span style="color: #0d087e;"><strong>Announcements in Canvas</strong></span></h3>
  <p>Canvas Announcements is used for any official course business or announcements, such
    as changing the due dates or the scope of assignments.&nbsp; There will be at least
    one announcement every week posted in Canvas Announcements. Week 1 has the most
    announcements.</p>
  <h3><strong><span style="color: #0d087e;">Canvas Inbox (email)</span></strong></h3>
  <p>E-mail should be used for any sensitive or personal communication. For example, a
    discussion about a health issue, or a missing assignment or a question about grades.
    Email is the official medium of communication recognized by BYU-Idaho and BYU Pathway
    Worldwide. You will get a lot of emails from the school.</p>
