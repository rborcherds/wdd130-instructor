<body>
    <p><span style="font-size: 18pt; color: #027634;">This is the only week where I allow
            posting a reply to a welcome to the week announcement. All other posts must be
            in Microsoft Teams.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 18pt; color: #e62429;">AI is not allowed to be used to
            write any code or fix any of your code. Do not use AI as a tutor. More about
            this latter. Do not install any AI related extensions into VSCode.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 24pt; color: #0d087e;"><strong>There are questions in this
                post that must be answered via email to me or a post in Microsoft Teams
                Introductions channel. This is required as I do track
                this.</strong></span></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I know some of you will feel overwhelmed by all the
            new terminology that you will be learning.<strong> Do not get
                discouraged</strong>, it will come with some time and practice. Everyone
            can learn to create a basic website, but not everyone can do this as a
            profession. My goal is to get you to the point of creating a basic website,
            you will have to decide if you can do this professionally.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Make sure to ask questions and for clarification for
            anything you do not understand. I am happy to clarify anything until you
            understand it.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>FYI: </strong>If you find something that
            does not make sense, make sure to ask for clarification. The instructions get
            updated on a regular basis and may not be worded in a way that you will
            understand them.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Class officially starts on <strong>Monday, October
                27, 2025 @ 12:00 AM UTC</strong></span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Class officially ends on <strong>Wednesday, December
                10, 2025</strong></span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Last day to submit late work is<strong> Thursday,
                December 11,</strong><strong>&nbsp;2025 @ 11:59 PM UTC</strong></span></p>
    <p><span style="color: #b60505; font-size: 14pt;">All Work is due at 11:59 PM UTC. For
            this reason you must set the timezone for where you live in Canvas. This will
            automatically adjust the due times to your local time.</span></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h2><strong><span style="color: #050b77;">Your responsibilities</span></strong></h2>
    <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><span style="color: #d70505;">You are responsible to
                read <strong>all Announcements</strong>. Announcements will clarify the
                instructions</span>. Each announcement covers what you will be doing each
            week and has a spiritual thought in it for each week.</span></p>
    <p><span style="color: #e62429;"><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">You are
                    responsible for using Microsoft Teams each
                    day.</span></strong></span>&nbsp; <span style="font-size: 14pt;">There
            is a lot of information put into Microsoft Teams to help you do your school
            work. All additional materials are posted into the Additional Materials
            Channel in Teams only. <strong>I do not share these in Canvas.</strong></span>
    </p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><span style="color: #d70505;">You must check the
                feedback on each graded assignment to see how to improve your work</span>.
            Each week's submissions build on the previous week. This means that if you do
            not fix something, it will affect future weeks.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><span style="color: #b60505;">You
                <strong>MUST</strong> follow the instructions word for word</span>. If you
            skim them, you will miss important information and struggle with the course
            material. <span style="color: #d70505;">Web development is a very
                detail-oriented profession</span>. Do not think that you can do whatever
            you want. You must follow the instructions and directions given in the course
            material.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Procrastination is an enemy in this class. Do not
            wait till the due date to do the homework. You will have due dates on Thursday
            and Saturday in this course. Plan on spending at least 1 hour a day on this
            course.</span></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h2><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Your first assignment</strong></span></h2>
    <h3>Your first assignment will be to install and setup the software.</h3>
    <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">You will download and install Visual Studio Code
            (VSCode). The instructions are given for Windows and MAC in the directions. If
            you run Linux, please contact me if you have issues. I run Linux as my OS
            every day.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 18.6667px;">Make sure to install only the 2 extensions that
            you will be prompted to install for this class. NO AI related extensions are
            allowed.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">You will then install a web browser extension call
            Web Developer. The instructions are for Google Chrome only. This extension
            will work in all Chromium browsers (Microsoft Edge, Brave, etc), Firefox and
            Opera. Let me know if you have issues installing this extension. You will use
            it multiple times each week. This course is setup to use Google Chrome only.
            All instructions refer to Google Chrome menu options only. Firefox, Opera, etc
            do not have all the features that Chrome has and you will not be able to use
            them for this class.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><span style="color: #0e68b3;"><strong>In your email
                    or post in Microsoft Teams, to me tell me which web browser you will
                    be using</strong></span>. Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge are the
            only 2 allowed to be used. The other browsers do not have all the DevTools
            options and/or have security turned on by default that will interfere with the
            course work.</span></p>
    <h3><strong>Create / Setup GitHub Account</strong></h3>
    <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">You must setup a GitHub account as all your coding
            assignments will be submitted using a URL from GitHub pages site. Make sure to
            follow the instructions carefully. <strong>If you have a GitHub account
                already, use that account.</strong> GitHub terms of use policy prohibit a
            user from having multiple personal accounts. </span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>DO NOT use a name with BYU, BYUI, BYUPW or
                any other combination that refers to the school or course name</strong>.
            You are not a representative of the school and as such not allowed to use
            anything that could represent that.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><span style="color: #6204a6;">The GitHub account you
                will be creating, is for you to use as a portfolio of you work. You will
                use this account in multiple classes and in a professional setting. This
                is why you are not allowed to use the course name or course code.</span>
            You will be cloning a repository, where you store your code,&nbsp; with the
            course code as the name for each programming class you have under the GitHub
            account. You can have unlimited repositories in your account. You must clone
            the repository from the instructions as it has the basic setup and contains
            the basic required file and folder structure to help you get started.</span>
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 18pt; color: #f00;"><span
            style="font-size: 14pt; color: #da0505ff;">You must use lowercase letters on
            GitHub.</span></p>
    <p style="font-size: 18pt; color: #f00;"><span
            style="font-size: 14pt; color: #da0505ff;">DO NOT&nbsp; INSTALL the GITHUB
            DESKTOP application. There is no reason or need for this application if you
            follow the instructions from the course and it adds a layer of complexity that
            is not needed.</span></p>
    <p style="font-size: 18pt; color: #f00;"><span style="color: #0d087e;">Send me an
            email or post this in Teams, with your GitHub username and state if you are
            retaking the course. <span style="color: #000000; font-size: 14pt;">If you are
                retaking the course, the material has changed. I need to give you specific
                instructions on how to setup for the course.</span></span></p>
    <p style="font-size: 18pt; color: #f00;">&nbsp;</p>
    <h3><strong>Installing Git, which is different from GitHub</strong></h3>
    <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">You must follow these instructions carefully. If you
            do not it will require a zoom meeting with me to fix. Accept all the default
            setting during the installation of Git. Windows users are the only ones that
            have to select the options. Mac users install Git by running a command on your
            computer and if Git is not installed, then you will be prompted to install
            XCode from Apple. You must install that to be able to do the coding
            work.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong><span style="color: #b34000;">As part of
                    these instructions, you will clone, or copy the code from GitHub to
                    your local machine. If this is not installed and configured correctly,
                    this process will not work</span>.</strong> This is a required part of
            the audit for your first submission<strong>. </strong>This is why if you are
            retaking this course you must let me know so that I can tell you how to setup
            your computer and GitHub repositories so you will use the new template.</span>
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h3><strong>Installing Microsoft Teams</strong></h3>
    <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">You must get Microsoft Teams installed and
            configured correctly. This is where the majority of all class communication
            will occur. All questions about the course and all course help will be done in
            Microsoft Teams. There is also an Introduction to Microsoft Teams tutorial in
            the instructions.</span></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h3><strong>Next is the Learning Activities</strong></h3>
    <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">This activity will take you through a few activities
            to teach you what you need to know to this weeks work. The learning activities
            from week 1 will be used every week and you will build upon them. You must
            understand these or you will have issues.</span></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1.5em;">Code-along
            activity</strong></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">There is a code-a-long assignment via a video. This
            cannot be done until you have all the software installed and configured
            correctly and you must do the learning activities. The link to the video on
            this is posted in Microsoft Teams only in the Additional Materials Channel.
            This is posted at the start of each week.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I post a lot of videos in Teams.</span></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h3><span style="color: #6204a6;"><strong>Building your Course Homepage - First
                submitted coding assignment for grade</strong></span></h3>
    <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">This is when you start to actually write your HTML
            and CSS code that will be graded.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Follow the instructions explicitly. When it says
            (lowercase, no spaces) next to the line of instructions, you
            <strong>MUST</strong> do that. You must use the filenames and folder names
            that the instructions give you.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">The instructions when it explains what needs to be
            in the footer. <strong>Please use the HTML Entity code</strong>. Not all
            computers can display emoticons. Emoticons is actually a font that is
            installed on your computer. There are companies and other users that do remove
            that font from their computer, so those symbols do not display correctly. This
            is the correct way to use the HTML Entity code.</span></p>
    <p><span style="color: #e03e2d; font-size: 14pt;"><strong
                style="color: #c01905ff;">&amp;copy; 2025</strong></span></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h3><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Late Work and Grading</strong></span></h3>
    <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I am a web developer and as a professional web
            developer, late work is unacceptable, clients prefer early. This is a great
            habit to get into. Think of me as your boss at a job. The Due Date is when you
            must submit your work for review. You then get 2 chances to make changes
            before your work goes before a client.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">With that said, this course is setup so that there
            will be certified graders doing all the grading. If you have a question about
            the grade, you must submit a question in the grade feedback area. They will
            address it with you directly. I will not be changing their grades. They go by
            the Page Audit from week 1 to 5 and the Rubric that is on every assignment,
            including week 6, that they grade.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">You are allowed to submit a total on 3 times. The
            assignments lock 1 week after the Due Date. Week 6 &amp; 7 lock the day after
            the last day of school which will always be on Thursday of Week 7.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Because this course is only 7 weeks, you must get
            things in on time.Late submission <strong>are not</strong> accepted beyond the
            end of week 7.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">My job is to help you understand the material and
            help you fix any issues you have. You must do the work. You must learn this on
            your own.</span></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h2><strong><span style="color: #050b77;">Error messages in
            </span></strong><strong><span style="color: #050b77;">VSCode or with Git
                commands</span></strong></h2>
    <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I give you this info now because a lot of you will
            get errors messages.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Take a screenshot of the error and send it to me
            using the Canvas inbox if you do not have Teams running. It is best to post
            the image into the Help Request Channel in Microsoft Teams. Do not send to my
            BYU Pathway e-mail. Those doe not always go through and sometimes get flagged
            as Junk e-mail when coming from your personal e-mail accounts. Do not use your
            cell phone for the screenshots. Make teh screenshots on your laptop/desktop
            computer and send me the screenshot from there.</span></p>

    <h2><strong><span style="color: #081470;">Additional Helps for the
                class</span></strong></h2>
    <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">You may also learn to use the <strong>built-in
                snip-it tools in Windows and MacOS</strong>. &nbsp;Read these articles on
            how to use them:&nbsp;</span></p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h2><span style="color: #081470;">Spiritual Thought/Question for the Week</span></h2>
    <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I want to share with you some truths about learning.
            This is something that I learned years ago and it has helped. There are a
            couple of scriptures I want to point you too. The first thing you need to
            understand is that all truth belongs to the doctrine of the kingdom. President
            Brigham Young taught "If you can find a truth in heaven, earth or hell, it
            belongs to our doctrine. We believe it; it is ours; we claim it" (DBY, 2).
            This does not mean just spiritual knowledge but secular knowledge as
            well.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">The first scripture is found in <strong>D&amp;C
                88:77-79</strong>. In these versus we find the commandment about gaining
            an education and how to teach one-another.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">77 And I give unto you a commandment that you
                shall teach one another the doctrine of the kingdom.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">78 Teach ye diligently and my grace shall attend
                you, that you may be instructed more perfectly in theory, in principle, in
                doctrine, in the law of the gospel, in all things that pertain unto the
                kingdom of God, that are expedient for you to understand;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">79 Of things both in heaven and in the earth,
                and under the earth; things which have been, things which are, things
                which must shortly come to pass; things which are at home, things which
                are abroad; the wars and the perplexities of the nations, and the
                judgments which are on the land; and a knowledge also of countries and of
                kingdoms</span></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Verse 79 gives us a great list of things to learn in
            our lifetime. Think of the terminology used to day for each items in that
            list: "In the heavens" for example are things like astronomy, space flight,
            satellites, etc.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Notice it does not say to pick one or two things but
            to learn all. &nbsp;This is one of BYU-Idaho's principles, teaching you to
            become a lifelong learner.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">The second scripture is found in <strong>Alma
                37:8</strong>. This is when Alma is explaining to his son Helaman about
            the writing on the plates and what his charge will be in keeping the record of
            his people. Verse 8 gives us a very helpful piece of information about how we
            can retain what we learn. I am bolding the part of the scripture I will be
            focusing on.</span></p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">8 And now, it has hitherto been wisdom in God
                that these things should be preserved; for behold, <strong>they have
                    enlarged the memory of this people</strong>, yea, and convinced many
                of the error of their ways, and brought them to the knowledge of their God
                unto the salvation of their souls.</span></p>

    <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">The word <strong>THEY</strong> is referring to the
            scriptures that Alma has been talking about. In other words, by studying the
            scriptures, you will be blessed with a greater memory and be able to recall
            things to your mind. I promise you, if you keep studying the scriptures
            everyday along with your schoolwork, you will be able to remember more and do
            better in school. It will take time to show your faithfulness to be able to
            get this blessing.</span></p>
