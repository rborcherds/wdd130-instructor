    <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I know some of you will feel overwhelmed by all the
            new terminology that you will be learning. Do not get discouraged, it will
            come with some time and practice. Everyone can learn to create a basic
            website, but not everyone can do this as a profession. My goal is to get you
            to the point of creating a basic website, you will have to decide if you can
            do this professionally.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Make sure to ask questions and for clarification for
            anything you do not understand. I am happy to clarify anything until you
            understand it.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>FYI: </strong>If you find something that
            does not make sense, make sure to ask for clarification. The instructions get
            updated on a regular basis and may not be worded in a way that you will
            understand them.</span></p>
    <p>Class officially starts on <strong>Monday, June 30, 2025 @ 12:00 AM UTC</strong>
    </p>
    <p>Class officially ends on <strong>Wednesday, August 13, 2025</strong></p>
    <p>Last day to submit late work is<strong> Thursday, August 14</strong><strong>, 2025
            @ 11:59 PM UTC</strong></p>
    <p><span style="color: #b60505;">All Work is due at 11:59 PM UTC. For this reason you
            must set the timezone for where you live in Canvas. This will automatically
            adjust the due times to your local time.</span></p>
    <h2><strong><span style="color: #050b77;">Your responsibilities</span></strong></h2>
    <p><span style="color: #d70505;">You are responsible to read <strong>all
                Announcements</strong>. Announcements will clarify the
            instructions</span>. I have a lot of helps and suggestion in the announcements
        and Microsoft Teams, Additional Materials channel.&nbsp;</p>
    <p><span style="color: #d70505;">You must check your feedback on each graded
            assignment to see how to improve your work</span>. Each week's submissions
        build on the previous week. This means that if you do not fix something, it will
        affect future weeks.</p>
    <p><span style="color: #b60505;">You <strong>MUST</strong> follow the instructions
            word for word</span>. If you skim them, you will miss important information
        and struggle with the course material. <span style="color: #d70505;">Web
            development is a very detail-oriented profession</span>. Do not think that you
        can do whatever you want. You must follow the instructions and directions given in
        the course material.</p>
    <p>Procrastination is an enemy in this class. Do not wait till the due date to do the
        homework. You will have due dates on Thursday and Saturday in this course. Plan on
        spending at least 1 hour a day on this course.</p>
    <h2><strong>Your first assignment</strong></h2>
    <h3>Your first assignment will be to install and setup the software.</h3>
    <p>You will download and install Visual Studio Code (VSCode). The instructions are
        given for Windows and MAC in the directions. If you run Linux, please contact me
        if you have issues. I run Linux as my OS every day.</p>
    <p>You will install just 1 extension for this class. It is called <strong>Live Server
            (Five Server)</strong>. Make sure to use this full name for the extension.
        There are other extensions with similar names.</p>
    <p>I will warn you now, if you install any extension outside of the ones required for
        class work, or recommended by your instructors, you could get into trouble with
        academic honesty. <strong>The use of AI in schoolwork is prohibited in this course
            and most courses</strong>. The Use of AI to help you in this course will
        create issues in that AI does not do things the way the course requires you to do
        the coding. In each course, the instructor will let you know if you are allowed to
        use AI.</p>
    <p>You will then install a web browser extension call Web Developer. The instructions
        are for Google Chrome only. This extension will work in all Chromium browsers
        (Microsoft Edge, Brave, etc), Firefox and Opera. Let me know if you have issues
        installing this extension. You will use it multiple times each week.</p>
    <h3>GitHub Account</h3>
    <p>You must setup a GitHub account as all your coding assignments will be submitted
        using a URL from GitHub pages site. Make sure to follow the instructions
        carefully. If you have a GitHub account already, use that account. GitHub terms of
        use policy prohibit a user from having multiple personal accounts. DO NOT use a
        name with BYU, BYUi, BYUPW or any other combination that refers to the school or
        course name. You are not a representative of the school and as such not allowed to
        use anything that could represent that. Also, the GitHub account you will be
        creating is for you to use as a portfolio of you work. You will use this account
        in multiple classes. This is why you are not allowed to use the course name or
        course code. You will be creating what is called a repository, where you store
        your code,&nbsp; with the course code as the name for each programming class you
        have under the GitHub account. You can have unlimited repositories in your
        account.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 18pt; color: #f00;">You must use lowercase on GitHub.</p>
    <p><strong>Do not create your repository on GitHub after you have created your
            account</strong>. This will be done using VSCode when you push your first set
        of code to GitHub. If you do, it will require a zoom meeting with me to fix.</p>
    <h3>Installing Git</h3>
    <p>You must follow these instructions carefully. If you do not it will require a zoom
        meeting with me to fix. Accept all the default setting during the installation of
        Git. Windows users are the only ones that have to select the options. Mac users
        install Git by running a command on your computer and if Git is not installed,
        then you will be prompted to install XCode from Apple. You must install that to be
        able to do the coding work.</p>
    <h3><strong>Next is the Learning Activities</strong></h3>
    <p>This activity will take you through a few activities to teach you about File and
        Folder naming. The web is case-sensitive, so this explains the best practices for
        that. You will then get an introduction to HTML and then you will learn about web
        images. This is one of the biggest reasons web pages are slow to load. You will be
        required to modify almost all of you images to make the file size small enough to
        meet the requirements of the course.</p>
    <h3><strong>Building your Course Homepage</strong></h3>
    <p>This is when you start to actually write your first HTML in this class.</p>
    <p>Follow the instructions explicitly. When it says (lowercase, no spaces) next to the
        line of instructions, you <strong>MUST</strong> do that. You must use the
        filenames and folder names that the instructions give you.</p>
    <p>During these steps you will create the GitHub repository from VSCode. You must make
        sure you select the correct options, or these instructions will not work. You have
        to publish your site you will be creating in GitHub. The instructions have these
        steps. Make sure to follow them carefully.</p>
    <p>The instructions when it explains what needs to be in the footer. <strong>Please
            use the HTML Entity code</strong>. Not all computers can display emoticons.
        Emoticons is actually a font that is installed on your computer. There are
        companies and other users that do remove that font from their computer, so those
        symbols do not display correctly. This is the correct way to use the HTML Entity
        code.</p>
    <p><span style="color: #e03e2d;"><strong style="color: #c01905ff;">&amp;copy;
                2025</strong></span></p>
    <h3>Late Work and Grading</h3>
    <p>I am a web developer and as a professional web developer, late work is
        unacceptable, clients prefer early. This is a great habit to get into. Think of me
        as your boss at a job. The Due Date is when you must submit your work for review.
        You then get 2 chances to make changes before your work goes before a client.</p>
    <p>With that said, this course is setup so that there will be certified graders doing
        all the grading. If you have a question about the grade, you must submit a
        question in the grade feedback area. They will address it with you directly. I
        will not be changing their grades. They go by the Rubric that is on every
        assignment that they grade.</p>
    <p>You are allowed to resubmit two times for 2 weeks after the Due Date. Weeks 5 to 7
        until date is the last day to submit work.</p>
    <p>Because this course is only 7 weeks, you must get things in on time. Assignments
        from the first 4 weeks are only available for late submissions for 2 weeks after
        the due date. After that, the late submission are not accepted beyond the end of
        week 7.</p>
    <p>My job is to help you understand the material and help you fix any issues you have.

    <h2><strong><span style="color: #050b77;">Error messages in
            </span></strong><strong><span style="color: #050b77;">VSCode or with Git
                commands</span></strong></h2>
    <p>I give you this info now because a lot of you will get errors messages.</p>
    <p>Take a screenshot of the error and send it to me using the Canvas e-mail system
        only. Do not send to my BYU-Idaho e-mail. Those doe not always go through and
        sometimes get flagged as Junk e-mail when coming from your personal e-mail
        accounts.</p>

    <h2><strong><span style="color: #081470;">Additional Helps for the
                class</span></strong></h2>
    <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I highly recommend you install a browser extension
            called FireShot. This extension allows you to capture an entire web page as an
            image in JPG, PNG, or Webp format.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">The Chrome extension (works in Microsoft Edge) can
            be found by going here: &nbsp;<a
                href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/take-webpage-screenshots/mcbpblocgmgfnpjjppndjkmgjaogfceg?hl=en"
                target="_blank"
                rel="noopener">https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/take-webpage-screenshots/mcbpblocgmgfnpjjppndjkmgjaogfceg?hl=en</a></span>
    </p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">The Firefox extension can be found here <a
                href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/fireshot"
                target="_blank"
                rel="noopener">https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/fireshot</a></span>
    </p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">If you are going to be taking the web development
            and design classes from BYU-Idaho, quite a few of the classes will ask you to
            make screen shots of the web pages you are creating. The FireShot extension
            will make it so much easier to create them. Fireshot is free to use the basic
            features.</span></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">You may also use the <strong>built-in snip-it tools
                in Windows and MacOS</strong>. &nbsp;Read these articles on how to use
            them:&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Windows: <a
                href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/use-snipping-tool-to-capture-screenshots-00246869-1843-655f-f220-97299b865f6b"

    </p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">MacOS: <a

    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Another program I highly recommend is called
            <strong>Flameshot</strong>: <a href="https://flameshot.org/" target="_blank"
                rel="noopener">https://flameshot.org/</a> - This runs on Windows, Mac,
            Linux.&nbsp; You can add things like arrows to your screenshots before you
            save them.</span></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Personal issues you must e-mail me using
                Canvas only and do that sooner than later. There will not be a lot of time
                to help resolve any issues if you wait.</strong>. </span></p>

    <h2><span style="color: #081470;">Spiritual Thought/Question for the Week</span></h2>
    <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">I want to share with you some truths about learning.
            This is something that I learned years ago and it has helped. There are a
            couple of scriptures I want to point you too. The first thing you need to
            understand is that all truth belongs to the doctrine of the kingdom. President
            Brigham Young taught "If you can find a truth in heaven, earth or hell, it
            belongs to our doctrine. We believe it; it is ours; we claim it" (DBY, 2).
            This does not mean just spiritual knowledge but secular knowledge as
            well.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">The first scripture is found in <strong>D&amp;C
                88:77-79</strong>. In these versus we find the commandment about gaining
            an education and how to teach one-another.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">77 And I give unto you a commandment that you
                shall teach one another the doctrine of the kingdom.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">78 Teach ye diligently and my grace shall attend
                you, that you may be instructed more perfectly in theory, in principle, in
                doctrine, in the law of the gospel, in all things that pertain unto the
                kingdom of God, that are expedient for you to understand;</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">79 Of things both in heaven and in the earth,
                and under the earth; things which have been, things which are, things
                which must shortly come to pass; things which are at home, things which
                are abroad; the wars and the perplexities of the nations, and the
                judgments which are on the land; and a knowledge also of countries and of
                kingdoms</span></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Verse 79 gives us a great list of things to learn in
            our lifetime. Think of the terminology used to day for each items in that
            list: "In the heavens" for example are things like astronomy, space flight,
            satellites, etc.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Notice it does not say to pick one or two things but
            to learn all. &nbsp;This is one of BYU-Idaho's principles, teaching you to
            become a lifelong learner.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">The second scripture is found in <strong>Alma
                37:8</strong>. This is when Alma is explaining to his son Helaman about
            the writing on the plates and what his charge will be in keeping the record of
            his people. Verse 8 gives us a very helpful piece of information about how we
            can retain what we learn. I am bolding the part of the scripture I will be
            focusing on.</span></p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">8 And now, it has hitherto been wisdom in God
                that these things should be preserved; for behold, <strong>they have
                    enlarged the memory of this people</strong>, yea, and convinced many
                of the error of their ways, and brought them to the knowledge of their God
                unto the salvation of their souls.</span></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">The word <strong>THEY</strong> is referring to the
            scriptures that Alma has been talking about. In other words, by studying the
            scriptures, you will be blessed with a greater memory and be able to recall
            things to your mind. I promise you, if you keep studying the scriptures
            everyday along with your schoolwork, you will be able to remember more and do
            better in school. It will take time to show your faithfulness to be able to
            get this blessing.</span></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><span style="color: #b50b0b; font-size: 14pt;">What is your favorite scripture
            about education and why?</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Post it as a comment Microsoft Teams Spiritual
            Thoughts channel. Posting is optional, but you should at least write it down
            in your journal or in Gospel Library in the notes section.</span></p>
