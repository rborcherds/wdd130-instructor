        <h2>Using Zoom with BYU-Idaho credentials</h2>
        <p>The first thing you need to do is to download Zoom and install it on your
            computer</p>
        <p>The download location is <a href="https://zoom.us/download"
                target="_blank">https://zoom.us/download</a></p>
        <p>Now that Zoom is installed, run it. You will get a screen that looks
            something like this:</p>
        <img src="//rborcherds.github.io/wdd130-instructor/announcements/images/zoom-sso-link.png"
            alt="Zoom login screen">
        <p>click the SSO button at the bottom</p>
        <p>You will then get a screen that looks like this. Make sure it says byui
            in the text box and click continue</p>
        <img src="//rborcherds.github.io/wdd130-instructor/announcements/images/zoom-sso-domain.png"
            alt="SSO Domain info page">
        <p>This will then open your default web browser for you to login to Zoom</p>
        <p>At this point the login page in the browser will look like your normal
            login page for access to the school resources. Login using the normal login
            procedure you use to access Canvas.</p>
        <img src="//rborcherds.github.io/wdd130-instructor/announcements/images/zoom-sso-login-page.png"
            alt="Zoom BYUI login page">
        <p>You will get this next screen once you are successfully logged into zoom.
            If you get a message to open an application, it is recommended that you
            click the ALWAYS option, then click teh blue Launch Zoom button.</p>
        <img src="//rborcherds.github.io/wdd130-instructor/announcements/images/zoom-launch-webpage.png"
            alt="Zoom launch application page">
        <p>Once you have successfully logged into Zoom on the web, you will be taken
            back to the Zoom application. There are a lot of things that you can
            only do via the web interface with Zoom. Not all information is in the
            application.</p>
        <p>You will want to take a few minutes to familiarize yourself with the zoom
            application and the option in the web interface. You will have some
            classes that will require you to record presentation using zoom and
            submit that as your homework.</p>
