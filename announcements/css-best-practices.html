        <h1>Beginners CSS Best Practices</h1>
        <p>Here are some CSS best practices for those learning CSS. No one will
            start writing better CSS overnight, it takes practice and tuning. Every
            experience is unique and you should keep an open mind in order to try
            things until they feel right for you.</p>
        <p>Don&apos;t be afraid to adopt tools to help you but also don&apos;t be
            too eager to jump into something just because everybody is doing so.
            There is an art level in understanding, writing, and organizing CSS.
            Whatever the rules you end up adopting, remain consistent.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h3>Plan you CSS</h3>
                <p>Before writing your CSS, plan your page layout and plan how you
                    are going to use your CSS. What general styles are going to be
                    needed, what different layouts do you need to create, what
                    specific overrides need to be created, and are they reusable?
                    Above all, you need to try to avoid too much overriding. If you
                    keep finding yourself writing styles and then canceling them
                    again a few rules down, you probably need to rethink your
                    strategy.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Use flexible/relative units</h3>
                <p>For maximum flexibility over the widest possible range of
                    devices, it is a good idea to size containers, padding, etc.
                    using relative units like ems and rems or percentages and
                    viewport units if you want them to vary depending on viewport
                    width.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Don't use a preprocessor</h3>
                <p>Don't use preprocessor syntax, such as Sass, Less, or Stylus.
                    These just add a layer of complexity that most sites do not
                    need.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Don't use resets</h3>
                <p>For maximum control over CSS across platforms, a lot of people
                    used to use CSS resets to remove every style, before they
                    building the CSS themselves. This certainly has its
                    merits, but especially in the modern world, CSS resets can be an
                    overkill, resulting in a lot of extra time spent re-implementing
                    things that weren't completely broken in the first place, like
                    default margins, list styles, etc.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>CSS comments</h3>
                <p>Use CSS-style comments to comment code that isn't
                    self-documenting. Also note that you should leave a space
                    between the asterisks and the comment for readability only.</p>
                <pre> /* This is a CSS-style comment */</pre>
                <p>Put your comments on separate lines preceding the code they are
                    referring to, like so:</p>
                <pre>
                    <code>h3 {<br>  
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    /* Creates a red drop shadow, offset 1px right and down, with a 2px blur radius */ <br>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;text-shadow: 1px 1px 2px red;<br>  
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/* Sets the font-size to double the default document font size */<br>  
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;font-size: 2rem;<br>
                        }<br>
                    </code>
                </pre>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Double quotes around values</h3>
                <p>
                    Where quotes can or should be included, use them, and use double
                    quotes. For example:
                </p>
                <pre>
                    <code>[data-vegetable="liquid"] {<br>  
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;background-color: goldenrod;<br>  
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;background-image: url("../../media/examples/lizard.png");<br>
                        }<br>
                    </code>
                </pre>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Longhand vs. shorthand rules</h3>
                <p>Sometimes you want to specify the padding-top or border-right but from
                    experience, you will often come back to these to add more so adopt the
                    habit to always use the shorthand to make it easier to change without
                    specifying many properties. It is easier to change and it is less
                    code.</p>
                <p>These values go in this order: top right bottom left. </p>
                <pre> padding: 1em inherit inherit inherit;</pre>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Selectors</h3>
                <p>When a rule has multiple selectors, put each selector on a new
                    line. This makes the selector list easier to read and can help
                    to make code lines shorter. </p>
                <p>Don't use ID selectors because they are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>less flexible; you can't add more to the id attribute if you
                        discover you need more than one.</li>
                    <li>harder to override because they have higher specificity than
                        classes.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Write CSS consistently</h3>
                <p>Consistency is key. Even if you are doing everything wrong,
                    remain consistent as it will be easier to fix them later. Find a
                    naming convention that works for you, adopt a CSS methodology,
                    organize styles the same way, define how many levels you nest
                    selectors, etc. Define your style and stick to it and improve it
                    over time.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Avoid too many font files</h3>
                <p>Maybe the designers handed you too many font files which is a red
                    flag. A website with too many fonts can be chaotic and confusing
                    so, always make sure you are including the fonts you will need
                    for the page. Fonts can take time to load and be applied and
                    when you have too many fonts your UI normally jumps into place
                    after the fonts are loaded.</p>
                <p>Always try to keep your fonts to just 2 font names.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Use CSS variables</h3>
                <p>The #1 reason to use a pre-processor in the past was the variables. CSS
                    variables are way better because they stick around when loaded in the
                    browser. The support is good and it allows you to create a more
                    flexible and reusable UI, without mentioning it helps you create a
                    more powerful design system and features.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Format Text with CSS</h3>
                <p>CSS can format your HTML text. No need to manually write all
                    caps, all lower or capitalized words in your HTML. Changing a
                    CSS property value is way faster to change than going around
                    changing all the text in HTML, and it is also better for
                    internationalization as it allows you to write the text as you
                    want and manipulates how it looks with CSS.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Let the content define the size</h3>
                <p>Instead of setting the width and height of a button, for example,
                    consider setting some padding for spacing and including a
                    max-width instead and max-height instead unless the design calls
                    for a strict size.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Avoid color names</h3>
                <p>Prefer to specify your color values with hex and color functions
                    instead of saying red, purple, or cyan. There are millions of
                    hex color values and no name for all of them. For consistency's
                    sake, find one way to add colors and stick to it.</p>
            </li>
            <p>
            <h3>Try to organize CSS to match the Markup Order</h3>
            <p>It sure makes for an easier way to understand your markup just by
                looking at your CSS. It is something I do and saves me a lot of
                time.</p>
            </p>
            <p>
            <h3>Keep HTML semantics and use CSS for styling</h3>
            <p>It is common to find developers who go around changing their HTML in
                order to apply a certain style. In general, let the styling to CSS
                and let your HTML structured in a way that makes sense semantically.
                There are exceptions to this rule but always ensure that the adopted
                structure does not go against any HTML semantic rules. Write your
                HTML first with content in mind, not styling. Then add CSS and try
                your best before changing your HTML for styling reasons.</p>
            </p>
            <li>
                <h3>Hyphens or underscore?</h3>
                <p>The most common separator for class and id names is a hyphen but
                    whatever you pick, stick to it. Hyphen is easier to read and
                    troubleshoot than an underscore.</p>
            </li>
            <p>
            <h3>Remove Unused CSS</h3>
            <p>For the same reason, you should ship the only CSS you will use,
                consider using tools like PurgeCSS to remove CSS that will not be
                needed in rendering. These tools will look at your CSS and HTML to
                determine which styles you will need. If you are not sure you need
                this, consider using browser tools that look for your code coverage
                which will tell you whether you are shipping unused style or not.
