            <h2>Ralph Borcherds</h2>
            <h2>Company Name</h2>
            <!-- In the header above, update the h1 to reflect the project name, change your name and company name. -->

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <hr>
        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <!-- These next two paragraphs will need to be updated to reflect the purpose of the website you are working on. -->
        <p>
            The website will convey the times of year we run, sell the supplies
            people need and promote river running as a whole. The entire family
            needs to be advertised as having fun and that it is a safe activity for
            all no matter if they are fit or handicapped. One day and two day trips
            will be the most advertised as well as week long trips will be
            advertised for the more adventurous individuals.
        </p>
        <p>
            The main message of our site will be: “Rafting is a fun activity for all
            to enjoy. Come and experience it for yourself and bring your family.”
        </p>


        <h3>Audience</h3>
        <!-- This section is where you will put who the audience is that you are creating this website for. This can be quite a complex section. This is the persona of your ideal client. -->
        <ul>
            <li>Adventurous</li>
            <li>Mid 20&apos;s to 50</li>
            <li>Upper middle class to upper class income</li>
            <li>Healthy lifestyle</li>
            <li>Family oriented for one and two day trips</li>
            <li>Single professionals for week long trips</li>
        </ul>
        <p>What do they want?</p>
        <ul>

                These people want a fun adventure to share with family or
                friends/co-workers
            </li>
            <li>They want to experience something new to them</li>
            <li>
                They want to re-experience the adrenaline rush you get while rafting.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Needs to being met?</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Buy outdoor supplies relating to water activities</li>
            <li>want a fun and safe way to satisfy an adrenalin rush</li>
        </ul>
        <p>What devices will be use to access the site?</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The site has to be desktop and mobile friendly. If it does not work on
                cell phones and tablets, Google will not give it high rankings in the
                SERP.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Style Guide</h2>

        <h3>Color Palette</h3>
        <!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

        <!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below Make sure to paste it into both spots -->

        <h3>Typography</h3>
        <!-- Choose a font for your paragraphs (body copy) and headlines. What font(s) have you chosen? Why did you choose what you did?  Make sure to review the list of web safe fonts at W3Schools.org as a starting point.  Think also about which of your colors above you might use for background and font colors. -->

        <h4>
            Heading Font: Halant
            <!-- change this -->
        </h4>
        <p>
            This is a nice wide and easy to read font for standing out as headings.
            <!-- change this -->
        </p>

        <h4 class="paragraphfont">
            Paragraph Font: Nunito Sans
            <!-- change this -->
        </h4>
        <p>
            This is an easy to read font with lots of text around it. You can follow
            this text quite easily.
            <!-- change this -->
        </p>

        <h4>Normal paragraph example</h4>
        <p>
            The best Whitewater Rafting in Colorado, White Water Rafting Company
            offers rafting on the Colorado and Roaring Fork Rivers in Glenwood
            Springs. Since 1974, we have been family owned and operated, rafting the
            Shoshone section of Glenwood Canyon and beyond.
        </p>
        <h4>Colored paragraph example</h4>
        <p class="colored">
            Trips vary from mild and great for families, to trips exclusively for
            physically fit and experienced rafters. No matter what type of river
            adventures you are seeking, White Water Rafting Company can make it
            happen for you.

            The Site Map of a site is just like it sounds…it is a map of the pages
            in a site and how they are related and linked together. From the map
            above we can see that we will eventually have the Home page and 2 sub or
            child pages.
        </p>
        <p>
            The lines that connect them all together indicate that each page should
            be accessible from any other page, it is essentially showing us the
            global navigation for the site.
