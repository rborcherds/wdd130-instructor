          <p>Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and
            Consonantia, there live the blind texts. Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove
            right at the coast of the Semantics, a large language ocean. A small river
            named Duden
            flows by their place and supplies it with the necessary regelialia. It is a
            paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of sentences fly into your
            mouth. Even the all-powerful Pointing has no control about the blind texts it
            is an almost
            unorthographic life One day however a small line of blind text by the name of
            Lorem Ipsum decided to leave for the far World of Grammar.</p>

          <p>The Big Oxmox advised her not to do so, because there were thousands of bad
            Commas, wild Question Marks and devious Semikoli, but the Little Blind Text
            didn't listen. She packed her seven versalia, put her initial into the belt
            and made herself
            on the way. When she reached the first hills of the Italic Mountains, she had
            a last view back on the skyline of her hometown Bookmarksgrove, the headline
            of Alphabet Village and the subline of her own road, the Line Lane. Pityful a
            rethoric
            question ran over her cheek, then she continued her way. On her way she met a
            copy.</p>

          <p>A wonderful serenity has taken possession of my entire soul, like these sweet
            mornings of spring which I enjoy with my whole heart. I am alone, and feel the
            charm of existence in this spot, which was created for the bliss of souls like
            mine.
            I am so happy, my dear friend, so absorbed in the exquisite sense of mere
            tranquil existence, that I neglect my talents. I should be incapable of
            drawing a single stroke at the present moment; and yet I feel that I never was
            a greater artist
            than now.</p>

          <p>When, while the lovely valley teems with vapour around me, and the meridian
            sun strikes the upper surface of the impenetrable foliage of my trees, and but
            a few stray gleams steal into the inner sanctuary, I throw myself down among
            the tall
            grass by the trickling stream; and, as I lie close to the earth, a thousand
            unknown plants are noticed by me: when I hear the buzz of the little world
            among the stalks, and grow familiar with the countless indescribable forms of
            the insects
            and flies, then I feel the presence of the Almighty, who formed us in his own
            image, and the breath of that universal love which bears and sustains us, as
            it floats around us in an eternity of bliss; and then, my friend, when
            darkness overspreads
            my eyes, and heaven and earth seem to dwell in my soul and absorb its power,
            like the form of a beloved mistress, then I often think with longing, Oh,
            would I could describe these conceptions, could impress upon paper all that is
            living so
            full and warm within me, that it might be the mirror of my soul, as my soul is
            the mirror of the infinite God!</p>

          <p>His room, a proper human room although a little too small, lay peacefully
            between its four familiar walls. A collection of textile samples lay spread
            out on the table - Samsa was a travelling salesman - and above it there hung a
            picture that
            he had recently cut out of an illustrated magazine and housed in a nice,
            gilded frame. It showed a lady fitted out with a fur hat and fur boa who sat
            upright, raising a heavy fur muff that covered the whole of her lower arm
            towards the viewer.
            Gregor then turned to look out the window at the dull weather.</p>

          <p>Drops of rain could be heard hitting the pane, which made him feel quite sad.
            "How about if I sleep a little bit longer and forget all this nonsense", he
            thought, but that was something he was unable to do because he was used to
            sleeping on
            his right, and in his present state couldn't get into that position. However
            hard he threw himself onto his right, he always rolled back to where he was.
            He must have tried it a hundred times, shut his eyes so that he wouldn't have
            to look
            at the floundering legs, and only stopped when he began to feel a mild, dull
            pain there that he had never felt before. "Oh, God", he thought, "what a
            strenuous career it is that I've chosen! Travelling day in and day out. Doing
            business like
            this takes much more effort than doing your own business at home, and on top
            of that there's the curse of travelling, worries about making train
            connections, bad and irregular food, contact with different people all the
            time so that you can
            never get to know anyone or become friendly with them. It can all go to Hell!
